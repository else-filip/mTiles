/// <para>An overlay in the main window like every other dialog here. It was a window of its own, on the

/// argument a tiling window manager settles the other way: on Hyprland the panel is placed into the
/// layout at whatever size the tiling decides, which is neither large nor where the user is looking.
/// Centred over a dimmed application it is at least always in the same place.</para>
/// <para>What went with the change is <c>KeepOnScreen</c>: capping the panel to its screen and
