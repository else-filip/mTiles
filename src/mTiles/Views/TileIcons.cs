/// <para>A kind names its icon with a string, and that is not a concession to layering: the phone needs
/// an icon name on the wire anyway, so a string is what the value actually is. This is the one place it

/// does — which picture stands for a thing is a fact about the drawing.</para>
/// <para>An unrecognised name falls back rather than throwing. A wrong glyph is legible; a tile header
/// that cannot be built is not, and the names come from kinds that may be registered by code this file
