/// sets, turning <c>ESC [ A</c> into <c>ESC O A</c>) and win32-input-mode, where keys travel as
/// INPUT_RECORDs. Handing a control a key event lets it decide the one way it decides for the keyboard.
/// Only the key <em>down</em> is raised: both consumers act on it, and the terminal's own encoder
