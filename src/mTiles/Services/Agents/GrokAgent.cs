/// <remarks>
/// <para><b>Added without a measurement, and it says so.</b> The CLI was not installed on the machine
/// this class was written on, so every table here comes from t3code, which runs it through ACP
/// (<c>GrokAcpSupport.ts</c>): the binary is <c>grok</c>, the login is <c>grok login</c> or
/// <c>XAI_API_KEY</c>, and the permission modes are <c>--permission-mode default|acceptEdits|auto</c> plus
/// <c>--always-approve</c>. Each of the other agents in this directory was measured against its binary
/// before it was trusted; this one is waiting for that run, and the conversation view
/// (<see cref="Sessions.Grok.GrokAcpSession"/>) is the part it was added for.</para>
/// <para><b>What is deliberately not claimed:</b> a way to resume a terminal session, a headless print
/// mode, a sign-in directory or a usage report. Each would be a flag or a path guessed rather than read,
/// and a wrong guess is a tile that fails in a way nobody can explain. So a terminal Grok tile starts a
/// fresh <c>grok</c> each time, a Goal run passes the prompt as a plain argument the way
/// <see cref="GenericAgent"/> does, and the conversation — which does resume, through ACP's
/// <c>session/load</c> — is the way to keep one.</para>
