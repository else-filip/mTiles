/// <remarks>
/// <para>Measured, and it needed a class of its own rather than the generic fallback: a bare positional
/// argument does not start a print run, it opens the interactive session and <b>hangs</b> — which, on a
/// path with no wall-clock timeout, is a Goal tile that never comes back.
/// <c>agy --print &lt;prompt&gt;</c> answers on stdout and exits 0.</para>
/// <para><b>An unknown conversation id is not an error here</b>, which is the trap this agent exists to
/// keep out of the launch chain: <c>agy --conversation &lt;unknown&gt;</c> warns, silently starts a new
/// conversation and exits 0. So a chain judging on the exit code cannot tell a resumed tile from a lost
/// one, and there is no local session store to consult — conversations live server-side. The way in is
/// to <em>pre-create</em>: <see cref="SessionCapture"/> runs one cheap <c>--print</c> with
/// <c>--output-format json</c>, takes <c>conversation_id</c>, and the tile launches with an id that is
/// known to exist.</para>
/// <para><b>It does have an effort flag</b> — <c>--effort low|medium|high</c> — which this application
/// previously said it did not, so every agy run went out at whatever the model name implied. Three
/// levels, so the canonical top two round down.</para>
/// <para><b>Re-measured 2026-09-04 against agy 1.1.26, and nothing here has moved.</b>
/// <c>--conversation</c>, <c>--print</c>, <c>--output-format json</c>, <c>--mode</c>, <c>--effort</c>
/// and <c>--dangerously-skip-permissions</c> all still spelled as below; a known id resumes (the answer
/// carries the same <c>conversation_id</c>), and an unknown one still warns <c>conversation "…" not
/// found</c>, opens a <em>different</em> conversation and exits 0. Two entries in agy's own changelog
/// are worth knowing about because they are exactly this path: 1.1.23 fixed subcommands hanging on an
/// inherited standard input pipe, and 1.1.24 fixed a headless <c>--print</c> run hanging on exit when
/// its output was piped — which is what <see cref="CaptureSessionAsync"/> does, so an agy older than
/// 1.1.24 can leave the pre-create hanging until its timeout.</para>
/// <para><b>Measured limitation:</b> <c>agy --print-timeout</c> defaults to five minutes, and nothing
/// here raises it. The Goal tile's "a run has no wall-clock timeout" guarantee therefore does not hold
/// on agy: a long implementation is cut off by the agent itself. Passing a larger value would be a flag
/// an older agy could refuse, which fails <em>every</em> run rather than the long ones — so this is
/// written down rather than worked around.</para>
