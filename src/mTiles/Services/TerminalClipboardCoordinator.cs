// Window-level Ctrl+C copy for terminals.
//
// Selection is created with the mouse in one terminal while keyboard focus may sit
// in another tile (the user switches tiles constantly). A per-tile key handler only
// sees key events when the focused element is inside its own tile, so it misses that
// case — and the unhandled Ctrl+C then sends SIGINT to the focused terminal.
//
// This coordinator listens once, on the window (tunnel), and copies from whichever
// terminal actually holds a selection: the focused one first, then the terminal the
// user most recently selected in, then any other live terminal. Without any selection
// Ctrl+C falls through and keeps its SIGINT meaning.
//
// Everything else is the control's own job and is deliberately not here: Ctrl+V (it
// pastes clipboard text itself), Ctrl+C within one terminal, and knowing when a
// selection appears or goes away (SelectionChanged).
//
// UI thread only, all of it: SelectionChanged and KeyDown are raised on it, and the terminal control is
// thread-affine anyway. Hence no locking — a lock on some of the state and not the rest is worse than
// none, because it reads as a promise. The mutating entry points assert the thread instead, so a caller
// that gets this wrong finds out at the call rather than through a corrupted list months later.
