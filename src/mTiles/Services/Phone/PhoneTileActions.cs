/// <para><b>This is the single point at which the open action set could quietly become the thing it
/// replaced.</b> The keys a phone can press are a closed enum decided at compile time; actions are not —
/// a kind registered later brings whatever it likes, and Git already has Discard changes and Undo last
/// commit. So the filter lives here, in mTiles, and never in the page: <b>a destructive action is not
/// offered at all</b>. Not "with a confirmation" — confirming on a phone something you cannot see is
/// theatre, and this codebase already holds that an unwired confirmation answers no.</para>
/// <para>It is also stricter than the keys are in one respect: an action is gated on being enabled for
/// this tile in this state, whereas Enter can always be pressed.</para>
/// <para>Pure, and separate from the manager, so the rule is readable in a test without a UI thread, a
/// socket or a tile.</para>
