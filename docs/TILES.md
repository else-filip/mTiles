# Tiles — one interface, a few capabilities, one kind registry

**Status: this is the code.** It was written as a plan before anything moved, and the reasoning below is
kept because it is why the shape is what it is rather than what it used to be.

The architecture is one a programmer new to C# can hold in their head: **one base interface that every
tile implements, a handful of interfaces extending it that announce optional abilities, and one class per
kind of tile.** Adding a seventh kind is one new class and one line of registration in
`App.BuildTileCatalog`.

## What was wrong before

There was no tile interface. The only thing the six kinds shared was `ObservableObject`. Two capability
interfaces already existed and already worked exactly as described below — `IBusyTile` (Terminal, Goal)
and `IFileContent` (the markdown tiles) — so this finished a pattern the codebase had started rather
than importing a new one.

The kind of a tile was a value in a closed enum rather than an object, and that value was switched on in
about thirteen places:

| Where | What it did |
|---|---|
| `Models/TileContentType.cs` | the enum |
| `TileFactory.CreateContent` (two overloads) | switch |
| `TileFactory.CreateFromDto` | second switch |
| `TileFactory.SerializeSettings` / `RestoreSettings` | `is GitTileViewModel` |
| `TileFactory.AllocateTileName` | switch, plus a `ref int` counter per kind |
| `Models/TileNode.cs` | `NoteFilePath`, `TodoFilePath`, `GoalFilePath` — a field per kind |
| `TileTreeSerializer.Serialize` | five `as XTileViewModel` casts |
| `WorkspaceViewModel.InitCountersFromDto` | `else if` chain over five counter fields |
| `Views/TileTypeIcon.cs` | `Kind()` and `AccentKey()` |
| `LeafTileView.axaml.cs` → `SetContent` | switch from view model type to view |
| `LeafTileView.axaml.cs` → `ContentInset` | `is TerminalTileViewModel` |
| `LeafTileView.axaml.cs` → `ApplyHeaderWidth`, `OnTileKeyDown` | `== TileContentType.Terminal` |
| `LeafTileView.axaml` | six chooser cards written out by hand |
| `Services/DefaultWorkspace.cs` | `ContentType = Terminal` |

`TileFactory` and `TileTypeIcon` are gone. `TileContentType` survives, **closed**, for one reason: it is
the exhaustive record of what is on people's disks, so it is what `TileNode`'s compatibility property
reads and what the "every historical layout still opens" test is written against.

Two empty classes existed only to feed that machinery: `NoteTileViewModel` and `TodoTileViewModel` were
bodyless subclasses of `MarkdownTileViewModel`, distinguishable by nothing but their CLR type — which is
what the view's type switch needed in order to pick between `NoteTileView` and `TodoTileView`. They are
now real classes over an abstract `MarkdownTileViewModel`, each saying what it is (`KindId`) and where
its files go, which is what the two have always differed by. The `.md` files and their folders are
unchanged.

## The whole architecture

```csharp
// The base. Everything that can be the content of a tile.
public interface ITile : INotifyPropertyChanged, IDisposable
{
    string KindId { get; }              // "terminal", "git", "note"…
}

// The capabilities. A tile says what it can do by what it implements.
public interface IBusyTile : ITile
{
    bool IsBusy { get; }                // the turning light on the workspace row
}

public interface IFileContent : ITile
{
    void RenameFile(string newName);    // the tile owns a file; the file follows the tile's name
}

public interface ITileActions : ITile
{
    IReadOnlyList<TileAction> Actions { get; }        // header buttons, and the phone
    Task<TileActionResult> InvokeAsync(string id);
}

public interface ITextInputTile : ITile
{
    bool TrySendText(string text, bool submit);       // where a transcript lands
    bool TryPressKey(TileKey key);                    // Enter and the arrows from a phone
}

public interface ICustomBackgroundTile : ITile
{
    Thickness ContentInset { get; }     // how far the content sits inside the card
    string ContentBackground { get; }   // hex — what that inset is painted in
}

public interface IProcessTile : ITile
{
    int? ChildProcessId { get; }        // the process it started; null between sessions
}

public interface IMaximizableTile : ITile
{
}                                       // no members — see below
```

### `IMaximizableTile` — worth the whole workspace

The one capability with **no members**, and the emptiness is the answer rather than an omission.
Filling the workspace is done *to* a `LeafTileNodeViewModel` by `TileMaximizeScope`; that is layout, and
none of the content's business. What only the content can say is whether the gesture means anything for
it — a yes or a no. A `bool CanMaximize` on `ITile` would be the same answer written where every kind
has to repeat it, three of them as `false`.

**Who implements it is a decision about what the extra room buys.** A terminal, an agent, a note and a
todo list are content that is simply *more of the same* at a larger size: more scrollback, more text,
more rows. **The goal tile is the fifth, by the same rule rather than as an exception to it** — it is a
conversation in a single column with nothing docked beside it, so the room buys more transcript, and it
is the tile whose content suffers most in the 300px column a workspace of four tiles leaves it: a plan,
a diff and a review full of file paths. The git, database and usage tiles lay themselves out in panes
and columns already sized to their own content — making them larger stretches whitespace rather than
showing anything more, and the two that own a splitter would end up with a splitter inside a tile with
no splitter around it.

**How it is shown, and why nothing moves.** `TileMaximizeScope` (one per workspace, exactly like
`TileActivationScope`, for the same reason: "only one at a time" is a fact about the workspace) writes
`SplitTileNodeViewModel.Solo` on every split between the root and the chosen leaf. A soloed split draws
that one child at full size instead of two children and a splitter — same `TileNodeView` children, same
`LeafTileView`, same `TerminalControl`. Nothing is re-parented into a second view, which is the one
thing a terminal could not survive: its control lives in the view, so a full-screen view built as a
*second* view of the same tile would hand the tile back afterwards with an empty shell.

**Nothing is persisted.** `Solo` is not serialized: maximizing is a way of looking at a layout, not a
change to one, and a workspace that reopened with half its tiles hidden and nothing on screen saying why
is a bug with no symptom. Switching workspaces keeps it, because the scope lives as long as the
workspace's view models do.

**Every way out puts the layout back.** Closing the maximized tile (`Dispose` → `Forget`), splitting it
(a new tile beside an off-screen one is a tile nobody can see), and clearing the root all restore first.
The path is *remembered* rather than re-walked, because each of those leaves the leaf pointing at
parents it no longer has — and a split left soloed on an unreachable child is half a workspace invisible
for the rest of the session.

On the header it is one button that changes shape: `Fullscreen` → `FullscreenExit`, lit while it is on
(`Button.tile-btn-on`), with **Ctrl+Shift+F** and an overflow entry. It never stands down at a narrow
width — the tile most worth expanding is the narrow one — while the split buttons stand down *because*
the tile is maximized: splitting restores first, so offering it there would read as "split this
full-screen view in two", which is not what happens.

**And a double-click in the empty part of the header does the same thing**, both ways: the gesture every
window manager already uses for it, on the one strip of a tile that is not the tile's content. It is a
second route to `ToggleMaximizeCommand` and nothing else, so a kind that cannot be maximized simply does
not answer. *Empty* is what the guards in `LeafTileView.OnToolbarDoubleTapped` define — not a button
(the second press of Restart shell would otherwise fill the workspace) and not the tile's name, which
answers the same gesture with the rename box and therefore claims it. It is bound in the markup rather
than added beside the drag handlers in the constructor: those tunnel on purpose, and this one has to
bubble so the buttons and the name label answer first.

### `IDescribedTile` — what the tile is *running*

```csharp
public interface IDescribedTile : ITile
{
    string HeaderNote { get; }
}
```

**Beside the name, never instead of it.** The name is the user's — typed, or generated as `Agent#1` —
and it is what they navigate by. This answers a different question the header could not answer at all:
two tiles both called `Agent#N` may be Claude Code on a subscription and Codex on OpenRouter, and
nothing on screen told them apart. `TerminalAgentTileViewModel` answers with its instance and the model the
launch settled on (`Claude Code · glm-5.3-flash`); no other kind implements it yet, and a kind with
nothing to add simply does not.

Drawn as metadata in the panel's own sense — plain, small, muted — and it is the **first** thing to give
way when the header runs out of room (`LeafTileView.HeaderNoteNeedsWidth`, wider than either button
threshold): a button that stands down is still in the overflow menu, while this has nowhere else to be
shown but is also the one thing nobody is trying to click. The full note is always the tooltip.

Changes arrive through `ITile`'s own change notification, so a tile relaunched on a different instance
redraws its header without the view knowing why.

```csharp
// One class per kind, registered once in App.axaml.cs.
public interface ITileKind
{
    string Id          { get; }         // "git" — this is what goes into the JSON
    string DisplayName { get; }         // "Git"
    string IconId      { get; }         // "source-branch"
    string AccentKey   { get; }         // "TileAccentGit"
    string NamePrefix  { get; }         // "Git", as in Git#1

    string NameFor(IReadOnlySet<string> used);            // what to call the next one
    IReadOnlyList<TileSetupOption> SetupOptions(TileContext ctx);  // what to ask first, if anything

    ITile Create(TileContext ctx, JsonObject? state);
    JsonObject? Save(ITile tile);
}
```

Who implements what:

| Kind | `IBusyTile` | `IFileContent` | `ITileActions` | `ITextInputTile` | `ICustomBackgroundTile` | `IProcessTile` | `IDescribedTile` | `IMaximizableTile` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Terminal | ✔ | | ✔ Restart shell (header only) | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ Terminal agent tiles only | ✔ |
| Note | | ✔ | | | | | | ✔ |
| Todo | | ✔ | | | | | | ✔ |
| Git | | | ✔ Refresh, Commit, Push | | | | | |
| Database | | | | | | | | |
| Goal | ✔ | | ✔ Continue, Pause, Commit work | | | ✔ | | ✔ |
| Usage | ✔ | | | | | | | |

**The usage tile implements exactly one, and the empty columns are the design.** It starts nothing, so
there is no `IProcessTile` answer to give — a dashboard that reported a working set would be reporting
this application's own. It owns no file, takes no dictation and draws no terminal. What a workspace does
need from it is the working light: a refresh reaches three services over the network and can take
seconds, and a dashboard that looks identical while it is asking is a dashboard nobody trusts. Its
`Save` answers `null` for the same reason — there is nothing per tile worth writing down, and
`TileKindIds.ToLegacy` finds no name for it, so a build Velopack has rolled back opens the leaf as an
empty tile. That costs a click; degrading it to a terminal, the way a terminal agent tile is degraded, would open
a shell nobody asked for.

`IProcessTile` is the root of a tree and not a process: a terminal knows the shell it spawned and nothing
about the agent that shell went on to start, which is where the memory actually is. A Goal tile
answers with the AI tool it has running, which is usually the heaviest thing in the workspace. Finding the rest is
`ProcessTreeMemory`'s job — the tile answers with one number and stays ignorant of operating systems. It
is `null` between sessions rather than stale, because a process id the system has reclaimed is a number
that now belongs to somebody else.

`TileContext` carries what every kind needs in order to build a tile: the working directory, the
`SettingsService`, the tile's own identity, and the callbacks a tile reports through (`RequestSave`,
`OpenSettings`). It is the right home for `TileSettingsChanged` and `OpenDatabaseSettings`, which were
wired by hand and are dependencies rather than capabilities — the second of them by the database tile's
*view*, which walked up the visual tree looking for a window whose data context was the main view model.

**`TileContext.Shells` is detected at most once every 30 seconds per context, which is once per
workspace.** Only the terminal kind reads it, and it reads it twice — to resolve the profile a tile was
created from, and to find again the shell a profile-less tile was last running. `ShellDetector.Detect()`
walks every directory on `PATH` and stats a handful of fixed locations, on the UI thread, while a
workspace is being restored, so a kind calling it per tile turns a workspace holding eight saved
terminals into eight scans. Asked for lazily, so a workspace with no terminal in it never pays; and held
in a field on the record rather than passed in as a value, so the `with` a terminal makes when it binds
its own `TileId` carries the same cache.

**A window, not the life of the workspace**, and that is the correction: the same list also answers for
a terminal the user adds by hand, and a workspace stays open for days — cached outright, a shell
installed this afternoon was missing from the chooser until the application was restarted, which is not
a connection anybody would make. It is `WorkspaceViewModel.GetAvailableProfiles`' own TTL, because the
two answer the same question about the same machine. The cache is a small class rather than two fields
on the record for a reason `with` makes: fields are copied by value, so two of them would be copied at
the moment a tile made its own context and would then expire independently — a cache per tile wearing
the name of a cache per workspace. A reference is copied as a reference.

**`TileContext.TileId` is a `Func<string>`, not a string.** The id belongs to the
`LeafTileNodeViewModel` that holds the content and moves under it: "New session" replaces the id of a
tile whose terminal keeps running. While it was a settable property on `TerminalTileViewModel`, four
places had to cast the content back to a terminal and push the new value in — the serializer, both
creation paths and the drag-and-drop swap — and any one of them forgotten meant a tile launching under
somebody else's session id. All four are gone.

**The function is bound to the tile it was built for, so content never moves between two tiles.**
Dropping one tile onto the middle of another exchanges the two leaves' places in the tree
(`TileTreeEdits.SwapPlaces`) instead of trading their `Content`, kind, name and `TileId`. Trading them
looks identical on screen and is not: four values changed hands and the fifth — the closure, which
answers with the id of the leaf that *created* the content — could not, so each terminal came out
reading its neighbour's id and "Restart shell" reopened the wrong `--session-id`. Swapping places has
nothing to keep in step: content, id, name and the leaf that owns all three never come apart.
`TileDragDropTests` asserts the pairing rather than the movement, because the pairing is what broke.

### Where a dragged tile can land

Three targets, and they are **ranked rather than weighed** — the workspace's outer band silences the
gutter, the gutter silences the tile — the same construction as the activity sources and for the same
reason: two of them answering at once is two hints painted at once and a drop whose result depends on
which handler ran last.

| Target | What the drop means | Room the tile gets |
|---|---|---|
| Workspace's outer band (28px) | A new column or row beside the whole layout | a third of the workspace |
| A split's gutter | Between the two tiles that split holds | a third of that split |
| A tile's edge (outer 30%) | Splits that one tile in two | half of it |
| A tile's middle | The two tiles change places | unchanged |

**The arbitration lives in `TileDropSurface` and nowhere else**, which is why that is the only control in
a tree a tile drag asks. A tile deciding for itself would have to be overruled
afterwards by whatever ranked the three, and that is two writers for one hint — the arrangement
`CLAUDE.md` records the tile header having already paid for. What a tile still draws is its *own* hint,
because that overlay belongs inside the card's clip and nothing outside it knows that radius.

**The drag is ours, not the platform's.** There is no `DragDrop.AllowDrop` anywhere in this gesture and
no `DoDragDropAsync`: on Windows that call is an OLE modal loop delivering every move through COM, and
it lagged visibly behind the pointer on a machine where the same build dragged smoothly under Linux. A
tile never leaves the window, so nothing the platform's drag offers — another application, a file, a
clipboard format — was ever used. `TileDragHandle` captures the pointer instead and
`TileDragSession.Over`/`Drop` hit-test the window and ask the surfaces themselves.

**The outer band has to overlap the outermost tiles, and that is forced rather than chosen.** A
workspace has **no padding at all** — it is a tile of the window's layout, and the gutter round it is the
window's — so a band living only in the padding would not exist. It therefore outranks the tile underneath, and 28px is the price: wide enough to
hit with a mouse, narrow enough that a tile 200px across keeps most of its own edge zone. Capped at a
third of the shorter side, so a workspace narrower than two bands still has a middle.

**A third, taken from both sides** (`TileDropRatio`, pure and argued in a table test). A drop on a
tile's own edge splits that one tile, so half is what the gesture said. A drop on a gutter or on the
workspace's edge says something else — between what is there, or beside all of it — and taking the room
out of one neighbour alone makes the gesture asymmetric in a way nothing on screen explains. Two panes
that were 80/20 come back 53/13 and are still 80/20 of what is left to them. The hint draws that same
band rather than a marker sized by eye, so what is under the pointer is the room the tile actually gets.

**Three tiles in a row are a split inside a split**, because the tree is binary. What keeps that from
reading as a nested pane is the pair of ratios, which is why `TileDragDropTests` asserts the three
*shares* rather than the shape: a nested split left at its own default renders as one wide tile beside
two narrow ones, and that is a layout, not a crash, so nothing else would catch it.

Two refusals are load-bearing. **A tile dropped on the gutter of its own split is left where it is** —
detaching it lifts its sibling into that split's slot and takes the split out of the tree, so the insert
would go into a node nobody draws and the tile would be gone; the gesture also asks for a layout that is
already on screen. And **the workspace's root is read again after the detach**, never captured before
it: with two tiles in the workspace, taking one out lifts the other into the root's own slot, so a root
read too early is a split that is no longer in the tree.

**The gesture is four pieces, and none of them knows which tree it is in**, so the same gesture can serve
a second level of tiles — the window's own layout — without a copy:

- `TileTreeEdits` (view model layer) — the edits: swap, split beside, insert between, put beside the
  whole tree, take out. It lives beside the node types rather than the views because closing a tile
  detaches it too, and a view model reaching into `Views/` for that was a layering fault.
- `TileDropGeometry` — the pure rules for where on screen a drop lands: a tile's zones, the tree's edge
  band, the room a split has once the dragged tile has left it.
- `TileDropSurface` — one per tree: resolves the target, ranks the three, draws the bands, runs the edit.
  What it looks for under the pointer is `ITileDropTarget`, not a view type, so a tile drawn by another
  view can be a target by implementing it.
- `TileDragHandle` and `TileDragSession` — the start of a drag (threshold, the double-click guard, the
  release Wayland drops) and the drag in flight: the pointer capture, the cursor, Escape, and the
  hit-test that asks the surfaces where the pointer is.

**Surfaces nest, and each answers only for its own tree.** Which tree a drag belongs to is *read*, never
stored: `TileDragSession.IsFrom` walks the dragged tile up to its root and compares it with the surface's
own. `TileDragSession.Over` hit-tests the window and walks the surfaces **innermost first**, which is the
bubbling the platform's drag events used to do for free; a surface that answers for no tile of its own
says so and the walk carries on outward to the surface that owns the drag. A gutter or a tile under the
pointer from a tree nested inside is walked past rather than taken. Nothing has to be kept in step when a
tile moves, because a tile that has moved already has a different root.

**The padding belongs to the surface, not to the view around it.** The walk starts at whatever the hit
test names and goes up the visual tree, so the eight pixels round a workspace answer as its edge only
because the surface draws them and is therefore what is hit there.

**A split can hold one side at a size in pixels** (`SplitFixedSide`, `SplitTileNodeViewModel.Fix`).
A share is right for tiles that should grow with the window and wrong for a tile whose size is a fact
about its content — a list of names wants the width a name needs, a strip of tabs one row. The fixed
side is laid out as a `Pixel` length and the other as a single star, so it takes whatever is left; the
splitter moves the pixels and leaves the ratio alone, which is kept so letting the side go puts the
split back where it was. **No workspace uses it**: only the window's own layout does, and a split with
nothing fixed writes neither field, so every existing layout is saved exactly as before and an older
build reads the ratio beside a fixed side as it always did. A side named without a usable size is read
as no fixed side at all.

The edits honour it in two places. **A gutter drop beside a fixed side goes into the other side** and
takes its third from there alone — wrapped in with the fixed tile instead, the two would be held at the
one tile's pixels between them. A drop on a fixed tile's own edge across its fixed axis is that same
gutter drop (`TileTreeEdits.FixedSplitAcross`), for the same reason. And **an edge drop can be given pixels** (`fixedExtent`), asked of
`TileDropSurface.FixedExtentFor` with the orientation of the split it would create, since what a fixed
size means depends on the axis. A workspace's surface answers null, which is the share an edge drop has
always given. The hints are drawn from the same rules (`TileDropGeometry.EdgeBand`, `GutterBand`) — a tile's own
edge drop given pixels included, which the surface paints instead of the tile's fixed-share overlay.

**Cross-workspace drops are still not possible**, and not because anything refuses them: only one
workspace's view is visible at a time, so there is never a second workspace's tile under the pointer.

### The window's own layout

**The same tree a workspace has, one level up** (`WindowLayoutViewModel`). Nothing about the node types,
the serializer, the fixed sides, the drag and drop or the full-screen scope had to learn there are two
levels; what differs is the catalog and two tiles the tree must always hold.

**The catalog is decided by what a kind needs** (`App.BuildWindowTileCatalog`): note, todo and usage,
because a terminal, an agent, a git or database tile and a goal all need a repository and the window has
none. It stands in for one where a tile asks — `AppPaths.GetWindowDirectory()` — so a note put beside
the workspaces keeps its file under `window/.mtiles/notes/` by the same rule that keeps a workspace's
notes in the workspace.

**Two kinds are permanent** (`ITileKind.IsPermanent`): the list of workspaces (`workspaces`) and the
place the open workspace is drawn (`workspace-host`). A property of the kind rather than of the layout,
because every refusal it stands for is asked of one tile, which knows its kind and not its tree: a
permanent kind is never offered by an empty tile's chooser or by Change type, a tile of one cannot be
closed or converted, and `WindowLayoutViewModel.AddTile` refuses one. Their view models hold nothing of
their own — the list and the cache of workspace views belong to the window and outlive any arrangement
of them, so disposing either tile disposes nothing.

**A file that does not hold each of them exactly once is replaced, not mended.** Mending it would mean
guessing where a list nobody put anywhere should go; the default is the one layout certainly usable, and
the notes such a file named stay on disk. **The default is never written down**: it is the window as it
looked before it had a layout, so the first launch after the update writes nothing and a window nobody
rearranges never gets a file. The unknown-kind rule is the workspace's: a tile of a kind this build does
not have leaves the file alone for the session.

**The list is the one tile with a fixed size, and the size depends on the axis**
(`WindowLayoutViewModel.FixedExtentFor`, which the window's drop surface will ask): beside the layout it
is as wide as it last stood — remembered, so a trip to the top and back does not reset it — and along the
top or the bottom it is one strip of tabs (`WorkspacesTileKind.StripHeight`). Asked before the drop is
carried out, so a list moved from one side to the other still reads its old split's width.

**How it is drawn.** The window's surface and tree replace the grid `MainWindow` used to hold, and the
tree is told which control stands for a tile (`TileNodeView.CreateLeafView`, passed down to every split):
the workspace gets a `WindowTileFrame` — no card and no header, only the drop target and the hint overlay —
round the panel of cached workspace views the window builds once and keeps, because the workspace is a
canvas of cards already. **Every other tile is an ordinary card, the list of workspaces included**: it has
the header every tile has, is dragged by it, and splits from it, and its `WorkspacesPanelView` is kept on
the tile's view model so a card rebuilt when the tile moves takes the same list back. No workspace's
shells end because the layout changed. A tile is added to the window by splitting one and choosing Note,
Todo or Usage in the empty tile — there is no separate add button. Splitting a tile held at a size in
pixels along the split's own axis puts the new tile beside that pane (`TileTreeEdits.InsertIntoGutter`),
the same place a drop on that edge puts one; the list is 240 px chosen for names, and a note squeezed
into it is not what a split asked for.

**A tile put beside the workspaces is narrow** (`WindowTileSize`, pure and table-tested). A note, a todo
list or a usage dashboard sits beside the workspaces rather than in place of them, and the half of
whatever it was dropped on that a workspace tile gets took half the window away from the workspace. So a
window tile is given **320 px wide or 220 px tall while the window has room for that twice over, and 30%
of the room when it has not** — pixels stay put when the window is resized, and the workspace takes the
difference; on a small window the same pixels would be most of it, so it scales instead. It applies to
every way such a tile arrives: a drop on the window's edge, on a tile's edge or on a gutter
(`TileDropSurface.SizeFor`, answered by `WindowLayoutViewModel.DropSizeFor`), and a split from a window
tile's header (`LeafTileNodeViewModel.SizeForNewTile`). What carries the answer is `TileDropSize` —
pixels *or* a share — because the two behave differently afterwards; no answer is what a workspace gives,
and there each edit keeps the share it always had. The hints draw the same room the edit will give.

**The window's hints are magenta, a workspace's keep their blue** (`DropHintBrushes`, the surface's
`HintBrushKey`). The two levels are drawn one inside the other and their hints are the same bands, so
over the same part of the screen a drop can mean "beside these tiles" or "beside the whole workspace",
and colour is the only thing left to say which. The surface says the colour and a tile under the pointer
is told it (`ITileDropTarget.ShowDropOverlay`), because the same card is drawn at both levels. Both are
derived in `ThemeBridge` — the window's from the theme's magenta with the phase markers' light-theme
treatment — and a test holds every built-in theme to giving the two different colours.

**The list becomes tabs by being short, not by being on top.** `WorkspacesPanelShapes.For` picks rows,
a strip of initials or a row of tabs from the size its tile has, so the one decision a drop makes — the
list's fixed size on that axis — is the whole of what changes its shape. See `CLAUDE.md` → *Workspace
panel*.

**A fixed pane's minimum never exceeds its own pixels** (`TileMinimumSize.ForFixedSide`). The minimum
keeps a splitter from squeezing a tile away; applied to a strip of tabs held at 40 px, it drew the strip
50 tall and overruled the size the layout chose.

**One tile in the window is active, at whichever level it was last touched**
(`MainWindowViewModel.ActiveTile`). The window's layout and each workspace keep a
`TileActivationScope` of their own, so each comes back to the tile it left — but activating a tile at one
level now calls `Deactivate` on the other, so only one outline is on screen, and `ActiveTile` answers from
the level that had the last activation. That is the tile the dictation shortcut and the phone bridge
fall back to once no text control has the keyboard. Left per level, a note beside the workspaces could be
where the user was typing while a terminal inside the workspace still wore the outline and still received
the next dictated sentence — with auto-Enter on, a command in a terminal nobody was looking at. Choosing a
workspace hands the keyboard back to it; a window tile closed while it had the keyboard leaves nothing
active rather than falling back to a terminal, the rule `WorkspaceViewModel.ActiveTile` already follows.
Dictating *into* a window note needs nothing of this: text goes to the focused editor first, and a note is
not an `ITextInputTile`, so it has no microphone of its own.

**What the window layout does not do, on purpose.** A tile does not move between levels — a workspace note
is not dragged into the window or back — because the two keep their files in different places and a
kind's fitness for a level is decided by what it needs. The workspace tile itself is never dragged: every
arrangement is reachable by moving the others round it, and it has no header to take hold of.

**Two pieces of `WorkspaceViewModel` became shared rather than copied**: `TileNameAllocator` (names are
unique per tree) and `TileTreeEdits.LeavesOf`. The rest of the two view models differ for real — agent
files, database skills and the instruction-file sync belong to a workspace alone.

### Why `ITile` is this thin

The thinness is the design, not a shortcut. Three things were considered for it and rejected, and the
reason is the same each time: a member half the implementations cannot honour is a signature that lies.

- **`Refresh()`** — a note has nothing to refresh. An empty body or a `NotSupportedException` is exactly
  the workaround this whole change exists to remove.
- **`WorkingDirectory`** — Terminal, Git, Database and Goal keep it; the markdown tiles take it in the
  constructor to compute a file path and then forget it. It is an argument to creation, not state of a
  tile.
- **`Title`** — the tile's name belongs to `LeafTileNodeViewModel`. Putting it here as well gives one
  value two writers, which this codebase has already paid for once (see *One writer per property* in
  `CLAUDE.md`).

What is left — change notification and disposal — costs nothing, because all six kinds already implement
both. `LeafTileNodeViewModel.Dispose` therefore no longer asks `if (Content is IDisposable)`: a tile that
forgets to clean up stops being a thing anyone can write.

### The rule for adding a capability

Something earns its own interface only when all three are true:

1. **It is optional.** If every tile has it, it belongs in `ITile` or nowhere. Styling is the example that
   belongs *nowhere*: every tile is styled, through `DynamicResource` and `ThemeBridge`, globally. There
   is no capability there. `ICustomBackgroundTile` is not about theming — it is about the terminal being
   the one tile that sits inset from its card and paints that inset in its own ANSI background
   (`TerminalTheme.Background`, a literal hex the UI palette does not derive).
2. **It varies while the tile is alive.** If it does not, it is data on the kind, not an interface member.
3. **Somebody has to ask "can you do this?"** — that question is written `is` / `as`, which is what an
   interface is for.

`IMaximizableTile` passes all three and carries nothing: it is optional (five kinds of eight), it varies
while the tile is alive (an empty tile becomes a terminal), and the question is asked with `is`. A
capability may be a marker — what it must not be is a member half the implementations cannot honour.

`ITileActions` is the one that was close. `Actions` alone could sit on `ITile` returning an empty list —
an empty list is not a lie. But `InvokeAsync` travels with it, and on a tile with no actions that is a
method which can only fail. Kept as a capability. If all six kinds end up implementing it, promoting it
into `ITile` is a one-line change; the reverse is not.

## The catalog, and the one layering boundary

A tile's view is a `Control`, so a kind that built its own view would drag `Views/` into what the view
model can see — and `ViewModels/` never referencing `Views/` is a rule this project keeps. The catalog
therefore holds both halves in **one entry registered by one call**, while the interface the view model
sees knows nothing about views:

```csharp
public sealed record TileCatalogEntry(
    ITileKind Kind,
    Func<ITile, Control> CreateView);

public sealed class TileCatalog
{
    public TileCatalog Register(TileCatalogEntry entry);
    public ITileKind? Kind(string? id);          // the view model side
    public TileCatalogEntry? Entry(string? id);  // the view side
    public IReadOnlyList<TileCatalogEntry> Entries { get; }
}
```

One registration per kind is the load-bearing part. Two parallel lists — kinds here, views there — is the
arrangement that has already cost this codebase a bug: the comment on `ConfigureNewLeaf` records how a
list of callbacks copied by hand in `Split` left every tile after the first without dictation. A
duplicate id throws rather than resolving: one of the two would be unreachable, and which one would
depend on the order of two lines in a startup method.

`LeafTileView` resolves its content view through `Entry(content.KindId)`, **never by switching on the view
model's type**. A dictionary lookup is simpler than a six-arm switch, and it does not care whether two
kinds ever share a view model class. The empty tile's chooser is built the same way, from
`AvailableKinds` — six blocks of hand-written markup meant a seventh kind was a class, a line of
registration and a page of XAML nobody would think to look for.

An instance, not a static: there is no DI container here, so the catalog is built in `App.axaml.cs` and
handed down through `MainWindowViewModel` → `WorkspaceViewModel` → each tile. A mutable global registry
is the kind of thing two tests fight over.

The icon is a `string` rather than a `MaterialIconKind`, and that is not a concession to layering: the
phone needs an icon name on the wire anyway, so a string is what this value actually is. The map from
`IconId` to a `MaterialIconKind` lives on the view side (`Views/TileIcons.cs`), where `TileTypeIcon` used
to keep it, and an unrecognised name falls back rather than throwing — a wrong glyph is legible, and the
names come from kinds this file may never have heard of. `AccentKey` is a string for the reason it was
one before: the view hands it to `GetResourceObservable`, so a theme switch reaches it.

### Three factory methods became one

`TileFactory` had three ways in: create, create-with-profile, and create-from-DTO. The second and third
were the same thing seen twice — choosing a profile in the chooser *is* handing a new tile its initial
state:

```csharp
kind.Create(ctx, null);                                              // a fresh tile
kind.Create(ctx, new JsonObject { ["userProfileId"] = profile.Id }); // chosen from the profile chooser
kind.Create(ctx, savedState);                                        // restored from disk
```

Two branches that must produce identical results, with nothing checking that they do, became one branch.

### Saving belongs to the kind, not to the tile

Restoring has to happen on the kind — Goal takes its file path in the constructor, Terminal needs its
shell resolved before it starts — so putting `Save` on the tile would split one JSON shape across two
classes. Both on the kind keeps the format for one kind in one testable place, and keeps
`System.Text.Json` out of the view models entirely; the tiles expose ordinary properties (`Shell.Name`,
`FilePath`, `ShowDiffPanel`), as they already did.

The cast that implies lives in exactly one line, in a generic base:

```csharp
public abstract class TileKind<T> : ITileKind where T : ITile
{
    protected abstract T Create(TileContext ctx, JsonObject? state);
    protected virtual JsonObject? Save(T tile) => null;

    ITile ITileKind.Create(TileContext ctx, JsonObject? s) => Create(ctx, s);
    JsonObject? ITileKind.Save(ITile tile) => Save((T)tile);   // the one cast, and always sound:
}                                                              // this class built that instance
```

`TileState` (`String`, `Bool`) is how a kind reads that state: `TryGetValue` rather than `GetValue`,
because the file is on the user's disk and a number where a string was expected throws — a layout that
will not open is a far worse answer than a tile that comes back with its default.

### Changing a tile's kind, in place

`… → Change type ▸` turns a tile into another kind without moving it: same `TileId`, same place in the
tree, same activation. **The registry is what makes it nearly free** — `Create(context, state)` is one
way in, the view resolves by `KindId` through a dictionary, and `TileNode` gates the legacy fields by
kind, so nothing is left of the old kind in the layout. The only thing missing was that `Adopt` gives a
tile content without taking the previous content apart, because its only caller was an empty tile.

The order is the whole of the decision, and it is `LeafTileNodeViewModel.BeginChangeKindAsync` →
`ConvertToAsync`:

1. the kind is picked — nothing happens yet;
2. its own `SetupOptions` step is drawn **over content that is still running**, so a terminal goes on
   working while the shell for its successor is chosen, and Cancel has something to go back to
   (`_pendingKindId` is the one field that tells that step from an empty tile being filled in);
3. the question — one sentence from `TileConversion`, which says what this particular kind costs: a
   shell and its children die, a note's file is simply left where it is. An unwired `ConfirmAction`
   lets it through, this class's convention rather than the Settings dialog's;
4. only then is anything destroyed, and the new content is put in place **before** the old is disposed
   of, or the busy light, the header's actions and the background are owned by nothing for a moment.

The list also holds **the kind the tile already is**, where that kind has a setup step to ask — a
terminal moved to another shell, an agent tile to another CLI. It is then a reconfiguration rather than
a change of type: the question says so (`TileConversion.ReconfigureWarning`), the tile keeps the name it
is known by, and the setup it is already running is left out of the step (`ITileKind.IsCurrentSetup`),
since taking it would kill the shell to arrive back where it started.

Three consequences worth knowing. Keeping the `TileId` means `agent → note → agent` comes back to the
same conversation, because the session id *is* the tile id — a feature, not a leak. The name is
generated afresh on a change of kind, so a hand-typed one is lost: there is no "the user renamed this"
flag to consult — a reconfiguration keeps it, because the tile is still what it was. And
the old kind's state is not remembered, so going back gives a *new* empty tile of that kind — the note's
file stays on disk, but nothing points at it.

## Persistence and migration

**The layout must come back looking exactly as it went in.** That is the acceptance criterion for the
whole change, and everything in this section serves it.

One piece of good news set the cost: `JsonDefaults.Options` registers `JsonStringEnumConverter`, so
`ContentType` was **already a string on disk**. Going from an enum to a kind id is a change of type in C#
over identical bytes in the file.

What changed in `workspaces/{id}.json`:

```jsonc
// before                          // after
"ContentType": "Terminal",         "Kind": "terminal",
"ShellName": "PowerShell",         "Settings": { "shellName": "PowerShell",
"UserProfileId": "abc-123",                      "userProfileId": "abc-123" }
"NoteFilePath": "…/x.md",          "Settings": { "filePath": "…/x.md" }
```

What did not change at all: `SplitOrientation`, `SplitRatio`, `First`, `Second`, `TileId`, `TileName`,
`IsActive` — the whole geometry and identity of the tree. **No file outside `workspaces/{id}.json` is
touched**: notes, todos and goal files stay exactly where they are, and only the path recorded for them
moves within the JSON.

`Settings` is a `JsonObject` rather than `Dictionary<string, object?>`. Same bytes on disk, and it removes
the `val is JsonElement el` dance `RestoreSettings` used to do. It is omitted entirely when a tile has
nothing to say.

**`Empty` is not a kind.** It is the absence of one, and it stays that way: an empty `KindId` means a tile
that has not been given content yet, and the chooser and its placeholder glyph are what the view draws
for that. Registering a pseudo-kind for "nothing" would put a class in the catalog that can never build a
tile.

Five rules make the migration safe:

1. **The old fields stay as compatibility properties**, in the shape `WorkspaceState.RootPane` has for
   the `RootPane` → `RootTile` rename: the setter copies the value into its new home. A **blank** old
   field is not adopted — every leaf in an old layout carries all of them, so copying unconditionally
   would give a note a shell name of nothing. And `Settings`' own setter **merges rather than replaces**,
   because every old layout has `"Settings": null` *after* the per-kind fields and a plain setter would
   wipe what they had just put there.
2. **They are written as well as read** — the getters say the same values back out of `Settings`, so
   every layout this build saves carries both formats at once. Reading the old fields covers the update;
   writing them covers the **rollback**, and this application treats that as a real event: Velopack can
   put an older build back, `settings.json` is already written to survive it, and that build knows
   nothing of `Kind` or of `Settings`' per-kind keys. Given only those it reads every leaf as an empty
   tile — and then the first splitter drag saves the emptiness over the user's layout, which rule 3
   protects the *forward* direction from and nothing protected the backward one from. `.pre-kind.json` is
   a copy nothing tells the user about; this needs telling nobody. Three of the old fields are the same
   key (`filePath` for a note, a todo and a goal), so the getter is gated on the kind — writing all three
   would tell an older build that one tile is three kinds at once — and a kind that enum never had writes
   no `ContentType` at all, which is honest: that build could not have built it either, so it gets the
   same empty tile this build gives an unregistered kind. It is a bridge, not a format: when no supported
   build reads the old fields any more, the getters go and rule 1 stands alone.
   `TileNode.IsLegacyFormat` therefore asks **both** halves — an old field *and* no `Kind` — because an
   old field stopped being evidence of an old file the moment this build started writing one.
3. **`"Terminal"` → `"terminal"` is `ToLowerInvariant()`**, because the enum was already serialised by
   name. There is no number-to-name conversion anywhere in this migration.
4. **Nothing is saved for a workspace holding a kind the catalog does not know** — not the write a
   migration asks for, and not one of the ordinary ones either. That tile is shown as empty, never as a
   blank card, and its `TileId` is kept, so the empty card is still the tile that was there. This is the
   one route by which a user could lose a layout for good, and the migrating write is only the first of
   the writes that take it: a splitter dragged, a tile renamed, split or closed serialises the same tree,
   and a leaf whose kind is unknown serialises as an empty one — with no `.pre-kind.json` taken ahead of
   any of them. The refusal therefore sits on `WorkspaceViewModel.ScheduleSave`, where every one of those
   routes meets, and lasts the session: nothing in a running application can give the catalog a kind it
   was not built with, so nothing can make the file safe to write again before the user is back on the
   build that wrote it.
5. **A copy before the first migrated write** — `{id}.pre-kind.json`, once, never overwritten
   (`PersistenceService.BackupBeforeKindMigration`). `settings.json` has this rule already
   (`settings.bad-<timestamp>.json`); layouts did not, and this is the only moment at which every one of
   those files is rewritten at once. A tile layout is the one thing in this application a user cannot
   reconstruct from anything else. It fails soft: a copy that cannot be taken is a reason to log, not a
   reason to refuse to open the workspace.

**The test that enforces the acceptance criterion** is a golden file
(`TileLayoutMigrationTests.A_layout_written_before_kinds_existed_opens_unchanged`): a pre-migration
`workspaces/{id}.json` holding all six kinds and nested splits, loaded by the new code and compared node
by node — kind, name, `TileId`, orientation, split ratio, which tile is active, and which view model
class was built for each leaf. It is written out by hand rather than generated, which is the point of a
golden file: what has to keep working is the bytes on somebody's disk, and those cannot be regenerated
once the code that wrote them is gone.

### Naming, and the step before a tile exists

Two things a kind decides for itself, because the workspace and the empty tile used to decide them by
asking `kindId == TileKindIds.Terminal` — the branch on a kind that the whole registry exists to remove.
A seventh kind that wants generated names, or a question of its own before it is built, is a class and a
line of registration, not an edit to two view models.

**`NameFor(used)`** is handed every name this workspace has already given a tile of that kind — saved
layout included, and nothing is ever taken back out of it, so closing a tile does not free its number for
the next one. The default in `TileKind<T>` numbers after `NamePrefix`, one past the highest number
already in use; `TerminalTileKind` overrides it with `TileNameGenerator`, because several terminals are
open at once and `Terminal#3` says nothing about which is which. `WorkspaceViewModel` keeps the names and
nothing else — where there used to be five `int` fields, five parameters and a five-armed `else if`
reading them back out of a saved layout. `DB#…` is why `NamePrefix` is separate from `DisplayName`:
renaming that would rename tiles in layouts already on disk.

**`SetupOptions(ctx)`** is the profile chooser, generalized to the one shape a step like that has: a row
of cards, each of which is a label, a glyph and the state the tile is then built from.

```csharp
public sealed record TileSetupOption(string Label, string IconId, string AccentKey, JsonObject? State);
```

Picking one calls `Create(ctx, option.State)` — the same route the kind chooser and a saved layout
already share, so there is still one way in. Empty means nothing to ask and the tile is built on the
click, which is every kind but the terminal, and the terminal too when the workspace offers no profiles.
The kind describes the options; the empty tile owns only Back, because leaving a step is the tile's
business and not the kind's. The profiles themselves come through `TileContext.AvailableProfiles`, a
function rather than a list because the answer changes while a workspace is open — and it is the
workspace's *filtered* list, the one that leaves out a profile whose AI tool is not installed.
Restoring a saved tile deliberately does not use it: a tile that was running a profile must come back
running it, whatever the detector says today.

A kind cannot draw its own step, and is not meant to: `ITileKind` lives on the view-model side of the one
layering boundary the catalog keeps, so it describes what to ask and `LeafTileView` draws it with the
same loop it draws the kind cards with.

## Tile actions, and the phone

A paired phone can press what a tile offers it, beside the six keys.

```csharp
public sealed record TileAction(
    string Id, string Label, string Icon, bool IsEnabled = true, bool IsDestructive = false);
```

The phone asks the tile it has zoomed into what it can do — Git → *Refresh, Commit, Push*; Goal → *Continue,
Pause, Commit work* — alongside the three fixed keys, which are unchanged. The same list drives the tile
header's own Restart button and Ctrl+Shift+R (`LeafTileNodeViewModel.CanRestart`), which is what removed
the last `is TerminalTileViewModel` from `DoRestartTerminal`.

**A terminal offers the phone nothing, and that is the rule below applied to the tile that raised it.**
Restart shell was on this list, unmarked, and it was the one action guarded on one screen and not on the
other: the header asks *Restart shell?* first, because restarting kills whatever the shell is running — a
build, an agent halfway through a task — while a pocket sending the same id reached
`InvokeAsync` with nothing in between. That is `IsDestructive` by this file's own definition, so it
carries the flag and `PhoneTileActions` withholds it. Not a confirmation added to the phone: the phone
cannot be shown what the restart would cost, which is exactly the case the flag exists for.

**New session is deliberately not an action.** It replaces the tile's persistent identity — the session
an agent would otherwise resume — which belongs to the tile rather than to its content, and it is not
something to do from a screen that cannot show which conversation is about to be left behind. It stays a
command on `LeafTileNodeViewModel`, which is the object that owns the id.

**This does not weaken the doctrine `PhoneKeys` is written to.** That doctrine is: *what a paired device
can cause is decided in this process, not by the message*. It survives — the phone sends an id, the
manager looks it up in the current `Actions` of the tile it addressed, and an unknown id gets the same
answer malformed JSON gets, which is none. In one respect it is stricter than the keys are: an action is
gated on `IsEnabled` for this tile in this state, whereas Enter can always be pressed.

**A phone names the tile it means** (`tileId` on every request). It used to address "the tile that is
active, or the one the recording in flight is aimed at", and that one rule took three paragraphs of
defence: the caption, the list and the press each had to ask the same function or a Commit under Git's
name started a Goal run. Now the phone zooms into a tile and every command carries that tile's id; the
bridge finds it in whichever loaded workspace holds it (`IPhoneWorkspaces.Find`) and the tile the
phone was shown is the tile it presses, by construction. The desktop's active tile is only the fallback
for a recording from a phone that has chosen none.

The genuinely new risk is that the set is no longer closed *by kind* — a future tile could expose
something like Discard changes, and Git has `DiscardChanges` and `UndoLastCommitAsync` today. Hence
`IsDestructive`, and the hard rule: **a destructive action is not offered to the phone at all.** Not "with
a confirmation" — confirming on a phone something you cannot see is theatre, and this codebase already
holds that an unwired `ConfirmAction` answers no. The filter lives in `PhoneTileActions`, pure and
tested, never in the page — and it is the *same* function that decides what may be shown and what may be
pressed, so the two cannot drift.

**An action answers when it is allowed, and runs afterwards** (`PhoneBridgeManager.StartActionAsync`).
It is the one thing a phone can ask for that is not short — Continue on a Goal tile runs the whole
implement/review loop — and a request waiting on it would time out on the phone long before. A failure
is pushed to the phone that pressed (`{"type":"error","scope":"action"}`). Nothing here serialises two
presses, because the tile already does: the id is checked against what it offers **now**
(`PhoneTileActions.IsAllowed`), so an action already running is refused for being disabled.

### What a phone sees of a tile: `IRemoteViewTile`

The eighth capability interface, and the same bargain as the other seven: a kind that implements it says
what it shows on a phone (`DescribeForRemote` → `RemoteTileBody`: a chat, a screen, a status line and a
composer) and answers what a phone asks of it (`HandleRemoteAsync` → null, or the sentence the phone
shows). The bridge never learns which kinds exist. Three implement it — the Agent tile (its own
`ConversationState`, projected by `AgentChatProjection`), the Goal tile (`GoalTileViewModel.Remote.cs`,
through the very commands its buttons run) and the terminal, whose screen is read as text off the control
(`TerminalControl.ReadScreenText`). A kind that implements nothing is still drawn in the phone's
miniature of the layout — a layout with holes in it is not recognisable — and can be zoomed into if it
takes text (`ITextInputTile`) or offers a phone an action; otherwise it is drawn dimmed
(`PhoneTiles.IsReachable`, the one rule for both).

`RemoteVersion` is the part that is easy to get wrong: it must move whenever `DescribeForRemote` would
answer differently, because the bridge samples by it and describes a tile only when it moved. The two
chat tiles bump it on every property they raise and on every change to their transcript — conservative,
and a counter costs nothing, while a missed change is a phone showing a stale answer.

Wire format:

```jsonc
// phone → mTiles (a request; answered {"ok":true} or {"ok":false,"error":"…"})
{ "type": "action", "tileId": "…", "id": "continue" }
{ "type": "choose", "tileId": "…", "pendingId": "…", "optionId": "Accept" }

// mTiles → phone (pushed, for the tile the phone watches)
{ "type": "tile", "tile": { "tileId": "…", "view": "chat", "status": {…}, "chat": {…},
  "actions": [ { "id": "continue", "label": "Continue", "icon": "play", "enabled": true } ] } }
```

`PhoneKeys` keeps only the wire names and the routing. Enter and the arrows are not tile actions — they
are the keyboard, delivered to the tile the phone names — `ITextInputTile.TryPressKey`, or the tile's own
`HandleRemoteAsync` — and a dictated sentence goes to that same tile, so a sentence and the Enter that
submits it cannot part company. What a key *is* to a control moved onto the tile
(`ITextInputTile.TryPressKey`), because the answer depends on DECCKM and win32-input-mode — two modes the
terminal control owns and does not expose.

**The `TileKey` → `Key` map is one map** (`ViewModels/TileKeyPress.cs`), used by both destinations: the
focused text control `PhoneKeys` raises the event at, and the tile the key otherwise reaches. It was
briefly a copy in each, with the same `default:` throw and the same comment arguing that a fourth key
missed *in this one place* would go out as Enter — an argument that stops holding the moment "this one
place" is two. The throw stays, and it is safe to reach: every press is wrapped, and the phone is told
the key could not be delivered.

`DictationTextSink.LiveTerminal` is gone: it used to reach into `TerminalTileViewModel.CachedControl` and
ask whether the shell was still running, which meant everything on that route had to know what a terminal
is. It is `TileInput(tile)` returning an `ITextInputTile`, and the tile answers both questions itself.

## What deliberately stays out

- `CachedControl`, `AttachControl`, `ReplaceLaunchSession` — `internal`, terminal-only. `TileLauncher`,
  `ShellStarter` and `DirectLaunchSession` go on depending on the concrete class, because they are
  services of a terminal and not of a tile.
- `TileSettingsChanged` (Git, Database) and `OpenDatabaseSettings` (Database) — dependencies handed in
  through `TileContext`, not capabilities a consumer interrogates.
- `LeafTileNodeViewModel.HasProfile` — the one place left where the tile knows what a terminal is, and it
  is about the tile's own identity: "New session" generates a fresh `TileId`, which is only ever *used*
  by a profile script that puts `${tileId}` on a command line.

That nothing else qualifies is the result, not a gap. An `ITile` grown to eight members would be one that
had started absorbing what only one kind needs, and the empty implementations would be back.

## Tests

- `TileCatalogTests` — every kind has a unique id; every historical `TileContentType` name maps to a
  registered kind (the test that catches a user's layout opening as a row of empty tiles); `Save` →
  `Create` → `Save` round-trips to the same JSON; a kind builds a tile that agrees about what it is; a
  terminal follows the tile id it was given rather than a copy of it.
- `TileLayoutMigrationTests` — the golden file above, the one-time backup, a kind nothing is registered
  under leaving the file untouched, and the two properties of the format nobody controls: a blank old
  field is not adopted, and a trailing `"Settings": null` does not undo what the fields before it put
  there. Then the same claim the other way round: a layout this build writes, deserialised into the DTO
  the build before it had, comes back with its kinds, shells, profiles and file paths — and carrying both
  formats does not make the file look like an old one.
- `PhoneTileActionsTests` — nothing destructive is sent to a phone or reachable by naming it; a disabled
  action is shown and refused; and Restart shell is the *only* thing a shipped tile withholds, written as
  the exhaustive list so that a seventh action has to be thought about before the build goes green.

They all run through `TestTiles.Catalog`, which is the application's own `App.BuildTileCatalog` rather
than a list kept in step with it: a test catalog would answer questions about itself.
