// `LinkExceptions.cs` is the .NET half and the names line up one for one:
// PairingRefusedError is PairingRefusedException, and so on down the list.
// InvitationExpiredException is the one exception, and deliberately: only a
// host knows an invitation lapsed, it refuses in the same words either way,
// and this end — which only ever joins — could never raise it honestly.
// Two ports that disagree about which failures are worth telling apart are
// two ports an application has to learn twice.
//
// Every name is assigned from a literal rather than from the class, so that a
// bundler free to rename classes cannot rename what a page prints.
