// A session dies for many reasons — the relay went away, the tab was
// backgrounded, the host rebooted, the network changed underneath — and from
// here they all look the same and all get the same answer. Nothing above this
// is told; a request simply waits for the next session and is re-sent with
// the id it already had, which is what stops the far end running it twice.
//
// Only the reconnection lives here. What one session does is `link-session.js`
// and where a session comes from is `session-source.js`, the same split
// `DurableLink.cs` keeps on the .NET side.
