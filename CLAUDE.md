# mTiles

Cross-platform terminal manager — .NET 10 + Avalonia 12.

## Building and running

```bash
dotnet build 
dotnet run --project src/mTiles
dotnet test                     # tests/mTiles.Tests
```

**"deploy"/"deploy + push"** always means running `python deploy2.py` — it bumps the patch version,
commits `version.txt`, pushes, then tags and pushes the tag so CI builds Windows + Linux and cuts the
release. Never a manual `git push` or a hand-written version bump.

## Structure

- `src/mTiles/` — the application
- `src/mTiles.AgentSessions/` — **no Avalonia, no reference to the application**: the agent conversation contract (`Events/`, `Commands/`, `IAgentSession`), the pure `ConversationReducer`, the SQLite event store, git turn checkpoints, `AgentConversationHost`, and the protocol plumbing every agent shares (`AgentProcess`, `JsonRpcPeer`, ACP). A separate project so a later web view references it as it is — see [`docs/AGENT-CONVERSATIONS.md`](docs/AGENT-CONVERSATIONS.md)
- `src/mTiles.Controls/` — **controls, and nothing else**: Avalonia, no reference to the application, the
  same one-way rule `mTiles.AgentSessions` keeps. It names colours by role through `DynamicResource` and
  defines none of them, so a control drawn here takes this application's theme without being told. Holds
  `Picker` — the trigger-plus-searchable-list that replaced the model field's combo-box-versus-autocomplete
  dead end — see [`src/mTiles.Controls/README.md`](src/mTiles.Controls/README.md) — and `Notepad/`, the
  vendored `MarkdownViewer`/`NoteEditor` (see [`src/mTiles.Controls/Notepad/README.md`](src/mTiles.Controls/Notepad/README.md))
- `tests/mTiles.Tests/` — the launch chain, driven through a fake `IPtyConnection` injected via `TerminalControl.PtyFactory` (no shell is spawned). `ChainPolicy` holds the thresholds so a test drives the chain in milliseconds instead of sleeping through the real ten-second and two-minute thresholds. **Read [`tests/mTiles.Tests/README.md`](tests/mTiles.Tests/README.md) before adding a test**: no test waits on a real clock (every interval is shortened in `Kit/TestTimings.cs`), a rule is tested once as a table, and CI fails a test over 2 s that is not marked `Slow`
- `Models/` — DTOs and data models, no behaviour (Workspace, WorkspaceState, TileNode, SplitFixedSide (which side of a split, if either, is held at a size in pixels rather than a share — never written for a split that has none, so a workspace layout saves byte for byte as before), TileKindIds, TileContentType (closed — see Tiles below), AppSettings, AppDefaults, LaunchScripts, UserShellProfile, TerminalTheme, GitFileChange, CommitLogEntry, GoalTileState, GoalCommit, GoalFinding, GoalReviewResult, GoalClarifyResult, IGoalParsedBlock (the two members the JSON re-send round reads, so a clarification and a review get one round rather than a copy each), GoalCompletionCriteria, GoalRole, GoalEffortPreset, GoalStopReason, GoalReviewGateMode, GoalImageAttachment, SolidPrinciples, AiBehaviour, AiEffort, AiUsage, AiAgentInstance, AiProviderInstance, AiSignIn, AiModelInfo, ProviderCheck, SessionStrategy, ApiFlavor, InstallPlan, DatabaseSettings, DatabaseInstance, ManualDatabaseConnection, WorkspaceDatabaseConfig, WorkspaceAgentFileSyncConfig, SpeechSettings, PhoneSettings)
- `ViewModels/` — MVVM with CommunityToolkit.Mvvm (source generators)
- `Views/` — Avalonia AXAML + code-behind
- `Styles/` — design tokens (`AppTheme.axaml`) and global control styles (`Controls.axaml`, including GridSplitter). UI colors exclusively via `DynamicResource`, terminal ANSI colors separately in `TerminalTheme`. `BgCanvas` is the odd one out: it is what the tiles are laid on and the only colour here not meant to be looked at (see Split tiles architecture)
- `Services/` — JSON persistence (PersistenceService, SettingsService, WorkspaceService), TerminalAgentTileMigration (the terminal tiles that were an AI CLI in a shell, turned into terminal agent tiles once), GoalAgents/GoalAgentChoice (which agents a Goal tile may offer, and what a stored id means), InstallCommand (the line an install or a sign-in actually types into a tile — `InstallPlan.CommandLine` is for reading and never what runs), ExecutableFinder (a program on `PATH`, for the callers a GUI process cannot rely on its own resolution for), ClipboardHelpers (whether an AI CLI in a tile can take an image off this machine's clipboard at all — Linux only, where every one of them shells out to `wl-paste` or `xclip`, and where the absence of the one this session can use is silent in every direction), ThemeBridge, JsonDefaults, AppPaths, AppInfo, GitService/GitCommandRunner/GitDirectoryWatcher/WorkspaceGitWatcher (one watch over a workspace's tree, shared by the git and Goal tiles through `TileContext.GitWatcher`, started with its first subscriber and stopped with its last; it keeps its own noise floor — the ignored directories are asked for through `IIgnoredDirectorySource` rather than waiting for a git tile to supply them — and polls until the workspace becomes a repository, since nothing else retries)/GitIgnoreFile/GitIgnoreEditQueue (the one chain every `.gitignore` edit is queued on — ordered, so a line written and withdrawn a moment later does not survive, and waited on briefly at shutdown so none is abandoned mid-write), DiffFormatter, ProcessTreeMemory/MemoryDisplay (what a workspace's tiles are holding, and how that reads on its row), FileHelper, ProtectedStringConverter, TolerantEnumConverter, TileTreeSerializer, TileNameGenerator, TileMinimumSize, TileDropRatio (how much room a tile dropped between others takes, and how the tiles already there give it up — a third, out of both in proportion, so a pair that was 80/20 is still 80/20 of what is left to it), WindowTileSize (how much room a tile put beside the workspaces is given — fixed pixels while the window has room for them twice over, a share otherwise), SpecialDirectories, SafePathComponent (the one rule for turning an id into a directory or file name — an allow-list plus the Windows reserved names, because both the sign-in directories and the generated opencode files are named after ids that reach `settings.json` by hand), DefaultWorkspace, the Goal tile's engine (AiProcessRunner, AiBehaviours, AiEfforts, GoalWorkflowEngine, GoalRoles (which job a call is doing and how hard it thinks — pure, and the reason the commit can never be dear), GoalPromptBuilder, GoalStatePersistence, GoalLoopPolicy, GoalTilePolicy, GoalCompletionPolicy, GoalReviewGatePolicy/GoalDismissals (the pause between a review and the next attempt, and what a finding left unticked in it stops counting against), GoalTestPolicy (which step of a run has the tests run — every review, only once a review accepts the work, or the first review as well), GoalBaseline, GoalCommitter, GoalCommitPlan, GoalDiffContext, CommandDisplay, CommandLineLength, ElapsedDisplay, GoalStageDisplay, RejectedFlag, UnrecognizedModel (Claude Code refusing to start a headless run on a model it cannot verify against the gateway — the one recognisable failure that names itself and the route that still works), GoalResponseParser (with JsonRepair, the one pure rule that mends a block a model wrote by hand — an unescaped quote or a raw newline inside a string value — tried only after the parser has refused it and kept only if it then parses), GoalScopeFilter (the composer typed beside Detect/Review as a scope: its words a narrowing block in the prompt, its `@` paths a hard filter on the working-tree block), GoalStateStore, GoalTranscript, GoalImageStore, GoalImageMarker, SolidPrincipleCatalog, WorktreeReader, and its `@` file mentions — IFileMentionSource/WorkspaceFileMentionSource, FileSuggestionIgnore, FileMentionToken, FileMentionMatcher, FileMentionCorpus), the composers' attachments shared by the Goal and Agent tiles (ComposerEdit — the insertion at the caret and the removal of a marker or a mention, ComposerFileReference — a non-image file as an `@` mention, AttachmentStore — the copy in `.mtiles/attachments/` of a file from outside the workspace), AgentFileSyncPolicy/AgentFileSyncEngine/AgentFileSyncCoordinator/AgentFileSyncConfigStore/WorkspaceWorkGate (opt-in per-workspace CLAUDE.md ↔ AGENTS.md content sync — see *CLAUDE.md ↔ AGENTS.md sync* below), UpdateService (its Velopack manager is built lazily and fails soft — an installation it cannot ask about must not stop the main view model being built), CrashHandler, FileLogWriter, LogTraceListener
- `Services/Tiles/` — the tile registry (see *Tiles* below and [`docs/TILES.md`](docs/TILES.md)): ITileKind, TileKind<T>, TileCatalog/TileCatalogEntry, TileContext, TileState, AgentStateKeys (the names a layout writes an agent-running tile's state down under, shared by the two kinds that do — including `conversationId`, written only by an Agent tile that has been pointed at a conversation other than the one named after it), and one class per kind (TerminalTileKind, TerminalAgentTileKind, NoteTileKind, TodoTileKind, GitTileKind, DatabaseTileKind, GoalTileKind, UsageTileKind, and the window's two permanent ones, WorkspacesTileKind and WorkspaceHostTileKind)
- `Services/Activity/` — what a tile is doing and how it is found out (see *Tile activity* below): IActivitySource with OutputActivitySource/TerminalTitleSource/TerminalProgressSource/RecentOutputSource, IAgentActivityReader (the one layering boundary — the agent says what its signal means, this says nothing about agents), ActivityPolicy (pure: rank, freshness, the asymmetric debounce), TileActivityMonitor, ActivityMarkers, AnsiText
- `Services/Database/` — DatabaseServiceManager, DbHttpServer, DiscoveryService, DbRegistry, DbLogger, QueryHandler, SqlGuard, SqlGuardProfile, SqlServerProvider, PostgreSqlProvider, SubnetScanner, IDbProvider, DatabaseSkillWriter
- `Services/ShellStarter.cs` — one call that replaces whatever session a `TerminalControl` holds and hands the shell its startup script (`${tileId}` substituted, one line per `\r`). The control owns the rest: killing the old session, waiting for it, and gating the script on `ShellReady` for *that* session
- `Services/TileLauncher.cs` — launching a terminal or terminal agent tile: disposes the previous launch, asks the tile what it runs now (`ResolveCurrentScripts`), then either the direct-launch chain or a plain interactive shell. First launch and "restart shell" both go through it. It reads `TileId`, it never assigns it. **A launch that has to wait checks that it is still the tile's launch before it starts one**: preparation for an agent that creates its conversation first is a model call with a minute's timeout, and closing the tile cancels the capture — which ends the preparation *normally*, so without the check the launch carried on, started a session in a disposed terminal and left a chain owned by a tile whose `Dispose` had already run. `TerminalTileViewModel.BeginLaunch`/`IsCurrentLaunch` is that claim, and it answers no for a restart in the same window too — which is the two competing chains this one call exists to prevent
- `Services/DirectLaunchSession.cs` — one tile's command chain (see Shell Profiles below); disposable, and disposing it is what stops it relaunching
- `Services/TerminalClipboardCoordinator.cs` — window-level Ctrl+C across tiles (see Terminal key handling)
- `Services/AiBehaviours.cs` + `Services/AiEfforts.cs` — the **canonical vocabulary and scale** the whole application speaks: what each mode and level is called, how much each one lets an agent do, and what an agent whose own list is shorter is given instead. **Neither holds a flag.** They used to hold Claude Code's words under neutral names, which is precisely how a second agent came to be launched with the first agent's flags; the spellings are now on the agent classes (see *Agents* below). The rounding is asymmetric on purpose — **effort to nearest, ties upward** (being wrong costs money, and the tile is left alone where a shallow attempt spends as much of the budget as a careful one), **behaviour downward, never up** (being wrong the other way is somebody's repository under an unattended agent they never authorised) — downward *among the modes the agent actually has*: an agent with no weaker gate falls to `ToolDefault`, which passes no flag and therefore leaves the CLI's own configuration in charge, so what is promised is that nothing here ever asks for more than was wanted, not that the run comes out weaker. The chooser in Settings and the Goal tile's strip are both narrowed to the agent's `SupportedBehaviours`, so that floor is reached by a stored value and never by a mode somebody was offered. Both rules are applied in one place — `AiProcessRunner.Fit`, asked by the run and by the failure path that names a refused flag — so `SupportedBehaviours`/`SupportedEfforts` are enforcement rather than documentation; and the Goal tile's strip offers `AiBehaviours.Headless` **narrowed by the execution agent's own list** rather than the whole vocabulary, because `ask`, `accept edits` and `plan` each fail in their own way in a run with nobody to ask — and a mode the agent has no gate for is one the run would round away to `ToolDefault` while the strip promised otherwise. The instance's `ExtraArgs` reach a headless run too (`AiProcessRunner.AddExtraArgs`, at the position the agent itself names — `IAiAgent.ExtraArgsIndex`, in front of a positional prompt by default and in front of `--print` on agy, whose prompt is that flag's own value): they applied in the terminal agent tile and nowhere else, so `--add-dir` set on an instance silently did nothing in a goal run on it. They also count against the prompt's own budget (`AiProcessRunner.PromptBudget` takes the instance): the 256 characters `CommandLineLength.Budget` keeps back are for the agent's own flags, while these are unbounded user-typed text, so a prompt fitted without them passed the guard and then overflowed on a `.cmd` shim — the opaque `Win32Exception` the guard exists to replace with a sentence. Both still recognise the tool *rejecting* the flag it was passed (`RejectedFlag`, which learned a second shape for codex's `-c key=value`, since a refused config key does not read like `unknown option`): those are somebody else's CLI contract, it has moved once already, and "the AI tool reported a failure" over a usage message about a flag the user never typed names no cause at all. The setting itself is read tolerantly (`TolerantAiBehaviourConverter`) because it lives in `settings.json`: a mode written by a newer build and read after a Velopack rollback would otherwise quarantine the agent instances, the provider keys and the DPAPI-encrypted database passwords along with it. **`bypass` asks once before it is stored** — it is the largest single grant here, it applies to every Goal tile, and a combo box is a thin control for a decision whose first symptom is an unattended run that already happened
- `Services/Agents/` — **one class per AI CLI**, keyed by a string id the way `TileKindIds` and `IShellTerminal` are: `IAiAgent` (what it is called, how its session gets an identity, which API flavors it speaks, which behaviours and efforts it supports *for a given `AiUsage`*, the argv fragments that ask for them, its environment, its interactive startup and fallback commands, whether it reads its prompt on standard input — `AcceptsPromptOnStdin`, opt-in per agent because it is a claim about somebody else's CLI: Claude Code and opencode, both measured; the rest take it as an argument, fitted to the command line's budget — and how to read a line of its output), the `AiAgent` base that derives the blameable flag from the fragment and composes `Interactive` out of the agent's own `Resume` plus the instance's default behaviour, default effort and `ExtraArgs` (the same rule as `EnvFor`/`Configure`, and for the same reason — six classes wrote `Interactive` and all six ignored the instance, so a terminal agent tile ran on the CLI's factory settings whatever its row said) — **quoting those arguments is the shell's job, not the base class's**: `Interactive` is handed the tile's `IShellTerminal` and calls its `Quote`, because a `\"` escape means nothing to PowerShell and inside its double quotes a `$` interpolates, so an `ExtraArgs` entry carrying a quote, a `$` or a backtick used to be mangled or partly executed — and **the session id goes through the same quoting before `Resume` sees it**, because it is not ours to trust: a `TileId` read out of a hand-editable layout file, or the string a captured agent printed as its conversation id, is interpolated into a script handed whole to `powershell -Command`/`bash -c`, where a `;` in it is a second command running in somebody's repository (an id made only of quote-free characters — every real one — comes out unchanged, and an empty id stays empty, since that is what codex and agy branch on to start a plain session), `ClaudeAgent`/`OpenCodeAgent`/`CodexAgent`/`PiAgent`/`AntigravityAgent`/`GrokAgent` (Grok is **unmeasured** — added from t3code without the CLI on this machine, and it says so in its class), `GenericAgent` for a binary nothing is known about, `Sessions/` (`IConversationalAgent` — a separate interface an agent implements to be held as a conversation — `AgentSessionLauncher`, which resolves a conversation's launch by the same rules the terminal tile and the Goal run use, and one folder per agent holding its own session and the mapper from its protocol to the shared events; see *Agent conversation tile* below), `AiAgentCatalog` (the registry, availability, and one seeded `AiAgentInstance` per agent), `AgentAvailability` (why a configured instance cannot be run — one sentence, read by the chooser that hides it, the Settings row that explains it and the launch that refuses it), `AiSignInStore` (where a login's directory is and how it is made, owner-only), `SignInStatus` (what the CLI's own files say about that directory), `OpenCodeProviderConfig` (the generated config that is opencode's only route to an address), `OutputProxy`/`OutputProxyGlobalHook` (the token proxy — see *Token proxy* below) and `SessionCapture`.
  **Why a whole argv fragment rather than a flag and a value.** codex's effort is `-c model_reasoning_effort=high` — a config key, not an option — which no "flag plus value" shape can express; and codex's permission is two orthogonal axes (`--sandbox` × `-a`) while opencode's is a boolean. A subset of a closed enum could not describe these five, which is why `SupportedBehaviours`/`SupportedEfforts` return **lists**.
  **The model is the instance's, and it reaches the agent by the agent's own route** (`ModelArgs`, and `AcceptsModel` for the one that answers otherwise). Measured 2026-08-30: `--model` on opencode, codex, pi and agy; Claude Code takes `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` through `EnvFor` instead, which is the same route as its base URL and token. Four of the five used to read the field not at all, so an instance pointed at a provider ran on the CLI's default model against an address that usually does not serve it — a launch that succeeds and a run that fails. An agent that can carry no model **says so** rather than dropping one silently, and the tile refuses that launch: `AgentRuntime.RequestedModel` is the other half of it, because an unresolved `__first_loaded__` on a command line is a model name no provider has.
  **Why `AiUsage` is a parameter and not a property.** Measured: `opencode --variant` exists on `opencode run` and not on the TUI, so "what does this agent support" has no answer until you say *where*. It also carries the `GoalPhase`, which is what lets a phase that writes nothing run read-only whatever the tile's strip says — clarify, plan and summarise get their permission **from the agent, by phase**, and that is what stands between a second agent and the worktree `GoalBaseline` photographed only once. **Review is the documented exception, and on the default criteria it is the usual case**: `RequireBuild` and `RequireTestsPass` both default to on, and a build writes into `obj/` and `bin/`, so a review asked to establish them is given the execution phase's permission (`AiUsage.RunsProjectCommands`) — what keeps it from editing source is then the sentence in the review prompt and the baseline behind it, not the sandbox. Turning both criteria off is what makes the review read-only, and `AiUsage.MayOnlyRead` is the one question the agents ask so the two cannot drift apart.
  **Every table in there is somebody else's CLI, measured once** (2026-08-29, against Claude Code 2.1.251, codex-cli 0.141.0, opencode 1.18.18, pi 0.84.3, agy 1.1.22) and pinned by `AiAgentTests`. Three of them correct what this application used to believe: agy **does** have `--effort` and its `--mode accept-edits` is the canonical *auto*; codex was passing no permission flags at all, so every goal run used whatever the user's `config.toml` said; codex's second permission axis reaches only its interactive commands (`codex exec` answers `unexpected argument '-a' found`, so a headless run carries `--sandbox` alone — pinned as a whole argv rather than as a fragment, which is what let a fragment right about the TUI be wrong about the only place it was used); and opencode's `--auto` is the canonical **bypass** — "auto-approve permissions that are not explicitly denied (dangerous!)" — mapped by meaning and never by spelling.
  **A CLI can hold more than one login, and that is an account like any other** (`AiSignIn`,
  `AiSignInStore`, `IAiAgent.SupportsSignIns`/`SignInEnv`/`ReadSignIn`). A provider and a sign-in answer
  the same question — as whom does this agent run — so they are **one slot**, `AccountChoice`, and
  `AgentRuntime.For` is where "never both" is finally enforced: an instance carrying a sign-in *and* a
  provider would point the CLI at one subscription's directory while authenticating with somebody
  else's key, so the work is billed to the provider while every row on screen names the subscription.
  Measured 2026-08-30, each against an empty directory: `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (Claude Code 2.1.251 →
  `Not logged in`), `CODEX_HOME` (codex-cli 0.141.0 → `401 Unauthorized`), and for opencode 1.18.18
  somebody else's variable, `XDG_DATA_HOME`, pointed at `<dir>/data` rather than at `<dir>` itself
  (`opencode auth list` → `0 credentials`) — which is why `SignInEnv` answers a **block** rather than a
  name and a value, the same reason `EffortArgs` is a whole fragment. That one is **narrower than it
  first was**: it began as both XDG variables, which isolated the login and also took the user's own
  `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` — their default model, MCP servers and instructions — away from
  every tile on that sign-in, arriving silently by the one path `OpenCodeProviderConfig` spends a
  paragraph defending against on the other. Measured 2026-08-31: `XDG_DATA_HOME` alone answers
  `0 credentials`, so the config variable was never buying the isolation it cost. pi has
  one too, `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` (2026-08-31: with `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` out of the environment,
  `pi auth check --provider openrouter` answers `not_ready` against a fresh directory and `ready`
  against the default one) — **first recorded as having none**, from a reading of `--help` rather than a
  run, which is the correction `PiAgent` now carries in its own words. Only **agy** has none and says
  so: its binary carries no `*_HOME`, `*_DIR` or `*_CONFIG` variable at all, it keeps its state in
  `~/.gemini`, and it switches Google accounts itself in `google_accounts.json`. Inventing one would be
  a row the user could name, log into and never actually run as. **The default account sets nothing, and must not be "the variable pointed at
  the CLI's own directory"**: with `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` set, Claude Code keeps `.claude.json` *inside*
  that directory, while by default it keeps it at `~/.claude.json` and only the credentials in
  `~/.claude` — so pointing it at `~/.claude` yields a session that is logged in and has lost its
  projects, its MCP servers and its history. The variable is applied in `AiAgent.EnvFor` before
  `Configure` and before `ExtraEnv`, and for the reason that method is not virtual: an agent that forgot
  the line would run every one of its tiles on the default account whatever the row said. The
  directory is **derived** from the sign-in's id (`AppPaths.GetAgentAccountsDirectory()`), never stored
  as a path, so `settings.json` carries nothing that stops being true on the machine it is imported
  into; it is created owner-only, since the CLI is about to write a refresh token in it; and **nothing
  ever deletes it** — removing the row removes the row, and the confirmation says where the login stays.
  `AiSignIn.ConfigDirectory` is the **one exception and has no field on the page**: a path written into
  `settings.json` by hand, used verbatim, for pointing a row at a directory that already exists — another
  profile's, or one somebody keeps elsewhere. Nothing here rewrites it, which is the point; it travels
  with an export like every other non-secret, and on a machine that does not have that path the row
  simply reads as not signed in rather than quietly becoming the default account.
  A sign-in belongs to **one agent**, so the chooser narrows to it exactly as it narrows providers by
  flavor, and a deleted one makes the instance unavailable rather than silently the default account
  (`AiAgentCatalog.IsAvailable`, `AgentModelResolver`). It also relocates `sessions/`, which is why
  adding one is a *new* instance rather than an edit to an existing one: the tiles on it would come back
  without their conversations.
    **Five of the six keep a readable record of their own conversations, and four of them are read** (`Services/Agents/SessionLogs/`, reached through `IAiAgent.SessionLog`, default `null`). Two things nothing else can answer come out of it: **which conversation a tile is really in** — `/clear` and `/resume` inside the TUI change it, at which point the id in the layout resumes something nobody is looking at, and a *derived* id is exactly as wrong as a stale captured one; followed only where the store tells its own interface from a headless run (`IAgentSessionLog.TellsHeadlessRunsApart` — claude and codex), so a pi or opencode tile keeps the id it already had and only its gauge follows — and **how full the model's context is**, which a TUI paints into a footer no host can read off a pseudo-terminal. One port, one shared base that walks the candidates and turns every failure into `null`, and a table per agent, the same division `SessionCapture` makes. `IAiAgent.FollowsSessionChanges` is a separate question from having a store: opencode reads its own and does **not** adopt what it finds, because its resume is backed by an import document keyed on the *tile's* id, so a followed session id would leave the resume and its fallback naming two different conversations. **Grok answers `null` although its store is readable**: a terminal Grok tile resumes and captures no conversation, so there is no id to read it by. **agy answers `null` and says why**: its conversations are protobuf blobs in SQLite, with the working directory buried inside them and no token counts anywhere — a reader built on a substring search of somebody else's protobuf is a tile confidently resuming the wrong conversation. Measurements, the six wrong first guesses and the per-agent table are in [`docs/AGENT-CONVERSATIONS.md`](docs/AGENT-CONVERSATIONS.md) → *Reading an agent's own session store*; `AgentSessionWatcher` is what follows a store, debounced, never reading twice at once and knowing nothing about any CLI; `ConversationFollower` is the tile's collaborator that owns its lifetime and the window in which a conversation that appeared may be put down to this tile at all, so the tile itself keeps only what it alone can answer.
  **Sessions are three named strategies, not a branch per agent** (`SessionStrategy`): `Fixed` (claude, pi — the tile's own id is the whole of the bookkeeping; pi's `--session-id` both creates and resumes, while Claude Code splits them and is launched `--resume` first with `--session-id` as its fallback, because each of the two refuses what the other wants), `ImportedFixed` (opencode — `--session` only *continues* one, so `opencode import` brings the chosen id into being; see `OpenCodeSession`), and `CapturedAfterStart` (codex, agy — the agent names it and we find out afterwards, so the tile's session id is *writable* and its layout has to be saved at the moment the id is captured). **Neither captured agent is ever handed an id it has not seen**: `codex resume <unknown>` opens an interactive picker, which in a launch chain is a tile waiting for a keystroke nobody knows it wants, and `agy --conversation <unknown>` is worse in a quieter way — it warns, silently starts a *new* conversation and exits 0, so a chain judging on the exit code cannot tell a resumed tile from a lost one. An empty session id therefore starts a plain session. **How a tile id becomes a session id is the agent's answer** (`IAiAgent.SessionIdForTile`): four take it verbatim, opencode puts its `ses_` prefix on it — a tile that spelled the id itself handed opencode a bare GUID, which its own import rule refuses before the tile can launch. `SessionCapture` holds the two pieces of plumbing (run a CLI and read what it printed; find the newest `rollout-*.jsonl` **written since this tile started**, because resuming a stranger's session is worse than starting a fresh one), and each agent overrides `CaptureSessionAsync` for itself
- `Services/Providers/` — **one class per service an agent can be pointed at**, keyed by a string id: `IAiProvider` (its wire formats, its address, whether it needs a key, and how to ask it what it serves), the `AiProvider` base that makes every call answer rather than throw — a test button that throws is a dialog with a stack trace in it — `AnthropicProvider`/`CcsProvider`/`OpenAiProvider`/`OpenRouterProvider`/`ZaiProvider`/`LmStudioProvider`/`OllamaProvider`, `ILocalAiProvider` for the two questions only a server on this network can answer, `IManagedAiProvider` for the one question only a provider that *owns* a service on this machine can answer — is it running, and can it be brought up (`CcsProvider.EnsureRunningAsync`: probe by protocol, start `ccs cliproxy start` when down, poll for health, answer — asked from `AgentModelResolver.ResolveAsync` *before* any model question, which is how the terminal agent tile's `LaunchProblem` and the Goal run's refusal are the same sentence; a `cmd /c` invocation takes its arguments separately, never one pre-quoted string, and its reads are bounded by a drain deadline of their own — a daemonized child inherits the pipes and would hang the launch past the timeout otherwise) — `CcsProvider` being the bridge that runs Claude Code on a Codex subscription through a local OAuth proxy, which is why its flavor list admits Claude Code alone and why it is deliberately **not** an `ILocalAiProvider` (a fixed published address has nothing to discover, and a subscription has no loaded model), `AiProviderCatalog`, `ProviderEndpoint` (pure), `AiModelChoice`, `AgentModelResolver`, `ModelContextWindow`, `LocalProviderDiscovery` and `AgentRuntime`.
  **The model's context window is a tri-state like every other answer a provider gives** (`AiModelInfo.ContextWindowTokens`, `IAiProvider.ContextWindowAsync`): OpenRouter says it in the listing (`context_length`), LM Studio in its own (`max_context_length`), Ollama only on a per-model POST to `api/show` — which is why the question is per model and not read off the list — and `null` is *did not say*, never zero, because a guessed window reaches an agent's environment as a fact. **What spends that answer is Claude Code's pair of windows** (`ModelContextWindow`, the `UsesModelContextWindow` question — the gate that keeps the provider call away from the five agents that read none of it): on a third-party provider the CLI does not recognise the model id and *assumes* a context window of 200 000 for it — assumed wrongly by half, and the assumption is two failures at once. The compact failure is the older one: `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW` = **80% of the model's context, rounded down** (a margin this application chose — the CLI's documented default is the full limit — argued in a table test; below the variable's documented minimum of 100 000 nothing is set, because the CLI would clamp it up past the margin). The second is the stop the compact window cannot reach: the compact variable moves when compaction fires, not what the CLI *believes* the context is, so the hard `Context limit reached` fired at the assumed 199.8k on z-ai/glm-5.3-flash — advertised at 1 310 720 — with a million-token compact window that never came due (measured 2026-09-01). `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` is the documented correction — "override the context window size Claude Code assumes for the active model", applying directly to an id that neither starts with `claude-` nor carries `[1m]` — and it is handed the provider's context at **100%, unclamped**: the margin is an opinion about when to compact, and the assumption being corrected is a fact, which is also why a 32k model is told the truth there while getting no compact window at all. Each window typed on the instance (`AutoCompactWindow`, `MaxContextTokens` — Settings → AI, Claude Code only) is the whole answer for it when present, and one typed alone still triggers the resolution, because the other window is then derived from the model's context; the resolution is the fallback for the fields left empty, and it is cached for half an hour against provider, address and model, because the Goal tile resolves per AI call and OpenRouter's catalogue is a megabyte.
  **Compatibility is the intersection of two flavor lists and nothing else** (`AiProviderCatalog.IsCompatible`). That is what the four-member `ApiFlavor` buys: without splitting `/v1/chat/completions` from `/v1/responses`, codex and Ollama would be reported compatible — both "OpenAI" — and the launch would fail, and a pairing offered and then failed is worse than one never offered.
  **Two `null`s are load-bearing and neither is a zero.** A balance of `null` means *this service does not say* — only OpenRouter has an endpoint for it, and showing an absent figure as 0 tells a user whose key works that they have run out. A model's `SupportedEfforts` of `null` means *the provider did not say*, and `AiProviderCatalog.NarrowEfforts` leaves the agent's list untouched when it does: silence read as denial would empty the effort chooser for five providers out of six. An **empty** list is a different answer — a model that takes no reasoning parameter — and narrows to `ToolDefault` rather than to nothing, because a chooser with no options says nothing.
  **Not every agent is pointed at a service by its address.** Claude Code is — `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`
  redirects it — but opencode and pi keep their own **registry** of providers, identify one by *name*,
  and validate `provider/model` against a catalogue before opening a socket. Measured 2026-08-31: given
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` for an OpenRouter instance, `opencode auth list` reports it as the **OpenAI**
  provider, so the run went to api.openai.com while every row on screen said OpenRouter — and the bare
  model id was refused with `ProviderModelNotFoundError`. Three members carry the difference:
  `IAiProvider.KeyEnvironmentVariable` and `CatalogueId` (facts about the *service*, so they are stated
  once rather than per agent), and `IAiAgent.QualifiedModel` (the model spelled that CLI's way, asked
  once and used by the tile *and* the headless goal run so one instance cannot be spelled two ways).
  **`IAiAgent.SupportsCustomEndpoint` is the fourth and is not the same question as
  `IsCompatible`**: opencode and pi both speak `/v1/chat/completions`, and only opencode has anywhere to
  put an address — through `OpenCodeProviderConfig`, a generated file that is its only route to a local
  server, written per instance and rewritten every launch the way `OpenCodeSession`'s import document
  is. pi has none, says so, and `AgentModelResolver` refuses that pairing by name rather than letting it
  launch on pi's own default provider. agy is unmeasured and inherits the permissive default.
  **The key goes through the environment, and one of the variables is emptied rather than removed.** `IAiAgent.EnvFor` takes an `AgentRuntime` (the instance, the provider, and the model *resolved* for this session) and answers a dictionary whose `null` values unset — `TerminalTileViewModel.LaunchEnvironment` carries it to both launch paths and into `PtyOptions.Environment`. `ClaudeAgent` sets `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`/`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` and **empties `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`** (`""`, not a removal — the gateway's own recipe, read 2026-09-01: the CLI's auth resolution treats a missing variable and a present-but-empty one differently, and the missing one lets a cached claude.ai login answer; an empty value overrides an inherited global key just as surely, and an empty key authenticates nothing). It also sets **`CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY=1`**: without it a headless (`-p`) run verifies the model id against Anthropic's own families and refuses anything else before asking the model a question — measured 2026-09-01 against 2.1.250–2.1.252 with `z-ai/glm-5.3-flash` on OpenRouter, every spelling, env and flag alike; with it the CLI asks the gateway's model list, and a gateway that fails to answer is handled by the CLI and the run carries on. Never the startup script — that is typed into a live prompt and lands in the scrollback and the shell's history file. `EnvFor` is **not virtual**; what an agent overrides is `Configure`, so the rule that the user's own `ExtraEnv` is merged last cannot be dropped by an agent that forgets it.
  **`AiModelChoice.FirstLoaded` is resolved at every launch and never written down.** Persisting the answer is the same as not having the sentinel: the point of it is that changing the model in LM Studio does not also mean changing it in mTiles. **A resolution that fails stops the launch and shows the sentence** (`TerminalTileViewModel.LaunchProblem`, refused by `TileLauncher`, drawn over the tile by `TerminalTileView`) rather than substituting one of ours: the rule is `AgentModelResolver`, asked by both agent tiles *and* by the Goal tile's run — it lived in the tile alone, so a goal on an instance asking for the first loaded model launched with no model at all while the environment still pointed at the local server, and a model named on an agent that cannot carry one was dropped without a word; the tile that started anyway looked like it had worked, and the only account of the model it was really running on was a line in `%APPDATA%/mTiles/logs`. **It also refuses an instance whose provider is gone or is one this agent cannot speak to** — the same question `AiAgentCatalog.IsAvailable` asks as a filter, said out loud, because the chooser and the Goal tile's list hide such an instance while a tile restored from a layout is handed its stored one without anybody asking: the one path where nobody is choosing is the one where a silent fall back to the CLI's own account and model would never be noticed. Discovery is **on demand, never on a timer** (a scheduled sweep of a corporate network looks like reconnaissance) and verifies **by protocol, not by port** — an open 11434 is not proof of Ollama. It will usually find nothing, and whatever shows it has to say so: Ollama binds `127.0.0.1` unless `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0`, LM Studio needs "Serve on Local Network". **Neither has any authentication**, so a reachable instance is open to everyone on that network. Both are configured on the Settings dialog's **AI** page, which is also the only thing that calls `TestAsync`, `ModelsAsync`, `NarrowEfforts` and `LocalProviderDiscovery` (see *Settings UI*)
- `Services/WorkspaceAgentFiles.cs` — the files a workspace puts where its AI agents look (see *Agent-facing files* below), with `LegacyDatabaseSectionCleanup` beside it for what the writer it replaced left behind
- `Services/AppPaths.cs` + `Services/WorkspacePaths.cs` — the two directories this application owns, and the one-time move each performs from the name it used before the rename. **Both fail soft**: a move that cannot be made leaves the old directory in use rather than presenting a first run, because the first run saves. `WorkspacePaths` is the one inside the user's repository, so its move shows up as a rename in their next `git status` — visible and reversible, which is the most it can be
- `Services/Phone/` — the phone (see *The phone* below and `docs/DICTATION.md` → *Dictating from a phone*): PhoneBridgeManager (the tailcat-link host, pairing, the push loop and dictation routing), PhoneProtocol (the wire, pure), PhoneWorkspaces (`IPhoneWorkspaces` — the one seam onto the view model tree), PhoneTiles (what any tile is to a phone, and whether it can be reached), `Remote/` (the DTOs and the pure projections — AgentChatProjection, GoalChatProjection, LayoutProjection), PhoneTileActions, PhoneAudioCapture + RoutedAudioCapture, PhoneKeys (the six keys' wire names and where they land), TraceLoggerFactory, QrCodeImage, UiDispatcher. The page itself is `site/phone/`
- `Services/Speech/` — dictation (see `docs/DICTATION.md`): IAudioCapture/PortAudioCapture, AudioResampler, ISpeechToTextEngine with ParakeetSpeechEngine (+ParakeetVocabulary) and WhisperSpeechEngine, SpeechEngines (the one map from model kind to engine and to what it looks like on disk), SpeechModelCatalog, SpeechModelStore, TarGzExtractor, DictationService, TranscriptPostProcessor, DictationTextSink, HotkeyGesture, HotkeyCapture (what a keystroke means to something reading a new shortcut — shared by the Speech tab and the setup wizard, and pure, because it lived in view code where the "mark it handled only where it is taken" rule had no test), HotkeyAdvice, DesktopShortcuts/ShortcutSpelling/ShortcutOwner/WindowsShortcuts (who has already been given this shortcut — asked of KDE over its own D-Bus register, of GNOME through gsettings and of Hyprland through hyprctl, and on Windows read from a written-down table because it publishes no register at all; a shortcut the desktop has taken does not arrive here in the first place, and `Alt+Space`, the default, is taken on Plasma and on GNOME — but not on Windows, where the window receives it and `DefWindowProc` is what opens the window menu, so what the table lists is only what the window never sees. An owner says whether it can be given back, since the Start menu cannot), DictationHotkeyMachine, DictationHotkeys
- `Services/Shells/` — **one class per shell**, keyed by a string id the way `TileKindIds` is: `IShellTerminal` (id, display name, icon, where to look for it, interactive/command/no-profile flags, quoting, and the shell's own `export`/`unset` syntax), the `ShellTerminal` base that composes those into `WithEnv` and refuses a name that is not a variable name, `PosixShellTerminal` with `BashTerminal`/`ZshTerminal`/`GitBashTerminal` under it, `FishTerminal` (not a POSIX shell — it escapes inside single quotes), `PowerShellTerminal`, `ShellInstallation` (a shell **and** where it was found — the two are separate so quoting is testable without a filesystem, and `CommandLineFor` is the old `ShellCommandLine`), and `ShellTerminalCatalog` (the registry, detection, and the one tolerant lookup that reads both an id and the display name older settings and layouts store).
  **`cmd` is not in the catalog, and that is a decision.** It cannot run what this application asks a shell to run: it does not parse its command line by the `CommandLineToArgvW` rules the PTY backend quotes with, runs only the first line of a multi-line command, and does not treat `;` as a separator — all measured, and the last of those silently reduced OpenCode's own two-command chain to a bare shell. It used to be offered and then swapped for PowerShell behind the user's back, which meant a shell that was neither the one they picked nor the one running their commands. A stored `CMD` now finds nothing and falls back to the default — and so does a `$SHELL` the old Unix detection offered (`nu`, `ksh`, `dash`), which is why `SettingsService.ReportUnknownDefaultShell` logs the name once — remembering in `ReportedUnknownShellName` that it has, so the warning does not return every launch — and **leaves the name in the file**: a name this build cannot match is also what a shell added by a newer version looks like after a Velopack rollback, so clearing it would let the older build settle the question for the newer one for good. `DropCustomShell` is the one that does clear, because a path to an arbitrary binary is an answer nothing here could ever honour.
  **A name does not name a file, and on PowerShell it names the wrong one** (`IShellTerminal.Program(name, path)`). npm installs three shims per tool on Windows — `claude`, `claude.cmd` and `claude.ps1` — and PowerShell's own lookup prefers the `.ps1`, which Windows' default `Restricted` execution policy then refuses to load: `claude.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system`, on a machine where the CLI is installed and this application has just said so. Reported from a fresh Windows 11 Home, where every agent tile and the Sign in button failed that way; invisible on a developer's machine, where something changed the policy years ago. So the shell answers how it is told to run a program: every other shell keeps the name — which is also what keeps a per-directory shim (mise, asdf, volta, nvm) working, and on POSIX a name cannot resolve to something the platform then refuses to run — and PowerShell takes the path this machine found, through the call operator. **Except a batch shim handed an argument outside `ShellArgument.IsBatchSafe`** (no `&`, `|`, `<`, `>`, `^`, `%`, `!`, `"` or parentheses — a space or a backslash is fine, so a path under a profile such as `C:\Users\Jan Kowalski` still reaches the shim): a `.cmd` passes its arguments through `cmd.exe`, which reads `&`, `|` and `%VAR%` in them after PowerShell has taken its own quotes off, so a session id like `x&calc` would run a second command — that line falls back to the name, failing closed on a `Restricted` machine rather than running it. **Where** the binary is stays this application's answer (`ExecutableFinder.Anywhere`, `AiAgentCatalog.Locate`, which ask for `.exe`, then the `.cmd` shim, and never a `.ps1`), so the shell is handed a fact rather than sent looking. It is asked in one place per route — `AiAgent.Interactive` for both of an agent's commands, `InstallCommand.For` for Install…, and the Sign in line — for the reason `Interactive` is not virtual: six `Resume` bodies spelling their own binary is six chances to spell it as a bare name, and `PowerShellProgramTests` asserts that none of them does. **Deliberately not `-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` on the process we start**: that works, and it also lets every other `.ps1` in that tile run on a machine where an administrator switched scripts off on purpose — while still failing wherever the policy comes from group policy, which is exactly the managed machine it would be weakening. The claim is about somebody else's command lookup and somebody else's policy, so it is measured against a real `powershell.exe` under `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted`, with the bare name as the control case.
  **Why the environment members are on the shell and not only in `PtyOptions.Environment`.** Anything secret goes through the process environment — a startup script is *typed into a live PTY*, so it lands in the scrollback and in the shell's history file, which is why a key must never go that way. Since **Terminal.Avalonia 0.3.0** that block can also *remove*: a `null` value in `PtyOptions.Environment` unsets the variable, so a machine with a global `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` **can** be given a child that authenticates through `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` instead. That was one line in our own `PtyEnvironment.Build`, and it is the right route — `ShellEnvironmentTests` proves it against a real child rather than a fake that would only report what it was handed. What the shell's own `SetEnv`/`UnsetEnv` are still for is everything that has to happen *inside a shell that is already running*, and `NoProfileArgs` covers the other half of the same trap — the user's own profile overwriting what we set
- `Services/BackgroundInstaller.cs` — an `InstallPlan` run as a process of this application's own:
  no shell, no tile, `ArgumentList` rather than a composed command line, both output streams kept,
  and a timeout for the installer that is waiting for an answer nobody can give it. See *Where AI
  tools went*
- `Services/ChainPolicy.cs` + `Services/RelaunchBudget.cs` — the launch chain's rules and its rate limit, pure and separate from the loop that carries them out
- `Services/UiFontScale.cs` + `Services/InterfaceScale.cs` + `Services/TextScale.cs` /
  `Services/DesktopTextScale.cs` — the answers to "how big is this": the scale, the whole-window
  multiplier, and what the desktop says about this user's eyes. The first three are pure. See *Type
  size and interface scale* below
- `Services/TileScript.cs` — the one place that expands an agent script's placeholders (`${tileId}`, `${opencodeSessionFile}`), and the only thing that decides what an acceptable tile id is — a rule `OpenCodeSession` asks for rather than copies, because the same value also becomes a file name
- `Services/OpenCodeSession.cs` — how an OpenCode tile gets its conversation back (see Session resume below)
- `SettingsService` writes on a debounce **and** directly when the window closes, so both the write and the timer swap are locked, and the timer's write is wrapped: an unhandled exception on a thread-pool thread ends the process, and no settings save is worth the application

`ShellStarter`, `TileLauncher`, `DirectLaunchSession` and `TerminalClipboardCoordinator` drive a `TerminalControl` but draw nothing, so they live in `Services/` rather than `Views/` — which also keeps `ViewModels/` from reaching into `Views/`.

- `ViewModels/ComposerChips.cs`, `ComposerFile.cs`, `ComposerFileScanner.cs` — the chips above both composers, one per image marker and per `@` mention, read off the text rather than kept beside it; the marker spelling and the interleaving every session sends are `mTiles.AgentSessions.ImageMarkers`
- `ViewModels/TileActivationScope.cs` — per-workspace tile activation scope with suppression mechanism

## Key libraries

- **Terminal.Avalonia** (`PackageReference`, NuGet) — our own control: VT engine, ConPTY/forkpty and rendering, no third-party terminal or PTY package. Source lives at `D:\work\sources\Terminal.Avalonia`; to try an unreleased change, swap the `PackageReference` for a `ProjectReference` locally and swap it back before committing.
  - Three packages: `Terminal.Avalonia` → `Terminal.Emulation` + `Terminal.Pty`. Only the first is referenced; the other two come with it. `release.yml` builds again — the absolute-path `ProjectReference` that blocked it is gone.
  - It **is** the terminal: no template, no inner view, no `PART_TerminalView`. Focus it directly.
  - Detaching from the visual tree does **not** end the session (only UI timers pause), so moving tiles between panes needs no bracketing.
  - It never launches on its own, and never twice at once: `RestartAsync(options, startupInput)` is what this app uses — it kills the live session, waits for it to be reported dead, starts the new one and types the startup script into it once *that* session is ready.
  - **A session has an identity.** `SessionId` and `SessionExitedEventArgs.SessionId` are how a relaunch-on-exit tells its own session from the next one. Never infer it from elapsed time.
  - API used here: `RestartAsync`/`Dispose`/`IsRunning`/`IsDisposed`/`SessionId`, `Exited`, `WhenSessionEndedAsync(sessionId)` (the launch chain's one wait: it carries `ExitCode` — `int?`, null when there is none — and `Reason`, so "the command failed" is never confused with "we could not tell"), `Copy`/`ClearSelection`/`HasSelection`/`SelectionChanged`, `Palette`, `ScrollbackCapacity`, `RedrawShellOnResize`, `ForwardCtrlVWhenClipboardHasNoText`, `Title`/`TitleChanged`, `Progress`/`ProgressChanged` and `NotificationReceived` (OSC 9, since 0.3.2 — see *Tile activity*), and `ReadScreenText`/`ScreenVersion` (0.4.2: the screen as plain text and a counter that moves with it — what a paired phone is shown of a terminal), and `TimeProvider` (0.4.1: the clock a session's `Lifetime` is measured on — the tests hand it a `ManualClock` so the launch chain's two-minute threshold is an `Advance` rather than a wait). The startup script is handed to `RestartAsync` rather than typed with `SendText`, and the chain waits on `WhenSessionEndedAsync` rather than `WhenNotRunningAsync` — neither is called from here any more. **`Kill()` is deliberately unused**: it only asks the child to die, and the exit is reported when it actually does, so anything that kills and then starts races that report. `RestartAsync` sequences kill → wait → start and serialises overlapping restarts; `Dispose` ends the tile for good. Note this does *not* avoid the stall — `RestartAsync` calls `Kill()` itself and it blocks the UI thread for as long as the child takes (up to 2s). That is Open risk #3 in the library's ROADMAP, not something the host can fix.
  - Ctrl+C copies when there is a selection and sends SIGINT otherwise; Ctrl+V / Ctrl+Shift+V / Shift+Insert paste clipboard **text** (filtered). Keys go out as win32 INPUT_RECORDs whenever the child enabled `?9001`.
  - Ships the open-source console host (`conpty/<arch>/OpenConsole.exe`), which is what fixed opencode taking the shell down with it. `Terminal.Pty` delivers it through `buildTransitive`, so it copies to the app's output automatically — **verified in `bin/`, not assumed**. The files must stay next to the app: without them the session silently falls back to the in-box `conhost.exe`.
- **The dictation stack** (see Dictation below) — three packages, all of which carry native binaries:
  **PortAudioSharp2** (microphone; the one wrapper shipping prebuilt portaudio for win-x64 *and*
  linux-x64), **Whisper.net** + **Whisper.net.Runtime** (whisper.cpp), and **Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime**
  (Parakeet). Their natives land in `runtimes/<rid>/` — whisper's directly under the RID rather than in
  `native/`, which is its own loader's convention. **Verified in `bin/`, not assumed** — and now on
  every release by `.github/workflows/verify-natives.ps1`, which fails the build if portaudio, whisper,
  ggml, onnxruntime, OpenConsole or `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` is missing from the publish — the notices
  check moved in there because the workflow was carrying three hand-copied versions of it. It matches by
  file name anywhere in the tree (a self-contained publish flattens `runtimes/`) but **rejects foreign
  architectures**: a non-RID build carries every runtime, so name-only matching would pass by showing the
  arm64 copy — which is the failure it exists to catch, reported as a success. Each entry takes a *list*
  of acceptable names (the ggml trio's `-whisper` suffix is Whisper.net's own renaming, not a platform
  convention, and it has changed before). Deliberately **not** a leading wildcard such as `ggml*.dll`:
  that would let the base library satisfy the entry for the dispatcher, so all three would pass on one
  file — the trailing wildcards on the Linux names are safe precisely because they come after the part
  that tells the three apart.
- **Notepad.Avalonia** — **no longer a package**: its sources are in
  `src/mTiles.Controls/Notepad/` and are built here (MIT, same author — see that folder's `README.md`
  for what was changed against 0.3.1 and why). Its `MarkdownViewer` renders what the AI tool writes in
  the Goal tile's transcript **and every message and patch in the Agent tile — the user's own included**,
  which is what the vendoring bought:
  a viewer whose selection spans the whole document is the only thing that lets two lines of a diff be
  dragged through and copied together, and the package could not colour one — 0.3.1 has no syntax
  highlighting at all. `MarkdownViewer.HighlightDiff` is the opt-in that colours a ```diff block by
  line, ground and all, and `GoalMarkdownView` is what asks for it and pushes this application's own
  diff tokens into it. Wrapped in the transcript's own `ScrollViewer` on purpose: the control scrolls itself
  only when given a finite height and sizes to its content when it is not, which is what a message
  in a list needs. `ColorTheme="None"` is load-bearing — any other value makes it assign its own
  brushes over the tokens, and its default is Light — which is why the wrapper is
  `Views/GoalMarkdownView.cs` rather than a page of attributes: the control assigns those brushes in its
  own constructor, as local values, before any markup runs. The wrapper also refuses to open a link
  without asking, showing the address rather than the words.
- **AvaloniaEdit** — text editor. Requires `StyleInclude` in App.axaml. Text sync via `Document.Changed`.
- **Material.Icons.Avalonia** — Material Design icons. Requires `<MaterialIconStyles />` in `App.axaml` Styles. Usage: `<mi:MaterialIcon Kind="Close" />`.

## Design rules

The look the UI was brought to, as rules rather than history. **New UI follows these; changing one is a
decision about the whole application, not about the screen being worked on.** Each was paid for by
something that looked wrong on screen.

**Ground and shape**

- The window is **one canvas** (`BgCanvas`) with **cards** on it. A card is `BgBase`/`BgSurface`,
  `RadiusTile`, a 1px `BorderSubtle` hairline. The workspaces panel and every tile are cards.
- **One gutter width**, and it goes round the outside too (8px: `TileNodeView.TileGap` between tiles at
  both levels, and the window surface's padding round the outside). A card clipped by the window frame is
  not a card.
- **A card that draws an outline must not also clip.** `ClipToBounds` on the drawing `Border` clips to
  the rounded-down bounds, so at 125%/150% desktop scale the right and bottom edges vanish and the
  outline comes out as an L. Put the clip on an inner `Border` at `RadiusTileInner` (= outer radius less
  the border width, or the two rounded rectangles are not concentric).
- **One radius per role**: `RadiusTile` cards, `RadiusRow` list rows, `RadiusSm`/`RadiusMd` controls.
  Three radii in one 240px column read as a rendering accident.
- **A minimum size on a `DockPanel`'s fill child is not a reservation.** The docked children take
  their desired size first and the last child gets whatever is left — which in a short tile is
  nothing — so a `MinHeight` there does not claim room back, it makes the child render taller than
  the rectangle it was arranged in and paint over its neighbours. The Goal tile's transcript carried
  one and drew its last lines across the status strip and the composer. Whatever can collapse,
  collapses.
- **Full-bleed by default.** Only a terminal's content is inset from its card (`LeafTileView.ContentInset`);
  a tile whose content is its own chrome runs to the edge and takes the card's corners from the clip.
  An inset leaves a square-cornered rectangle floating in a rounded card.

**Colour**

- Every UI colour is a **role token** via `DynamicResource`, derived from the terminal theme in
  `ThemeBridge`. No literal hex in a view.
- **The longer the line, the quieter the accent.** A short bar (a selected row's leading edge) takes
  `AccentHover`; a whole perimeter takes `AccentOutline`. The same colour on ten times the length stops
  being a marker and becomes a frame.
- **A colour has to work at the size it is drawn.** The `TileAccent*` values were raised out of their
  40%-lightness band when they went from a 3px bar to a 13px glyph. **Known gap:** they were chosen
  against a dark `BgElevated` and `ThemeBridge` does not derive them, so on a light theme a header glyph
  is a pale colour on a pale ground. The fix is the one the phase markers already use
  (`ThemeBridge.Marker`, which pulls a colour toward the foreground when `IsDark` is false); it has not
  been applied here yet.
- **Selected is not hover.** Two states, two treatments — selected gets its own ground plus an accent
  leading edge. The same brush for both makes the selection unfindable while the pointer is in the list.

**Rows and lists**

- **One left edge per panel.** Filter, heading and rows share a margin; scrollbars go on the right.
- **One row height in a list.** Reserve the secondary line even when it is empty. Two heights
  interleaved leave nothing to line up and no rhythm to scan by.
- **The name never gives way.** In a `DockPanel` the docked child takes what it wants and the fill child
  gets what is left, which is how a row ends up as `B…` beside a fully spelled-out branch, or a tile
  header shows five buttons and no title. Either give the secondary thing its **own line**, or stand
  *it* down below a width (`LeafTileView.SplitButtonsNeedWidth`).
- **Chips are for the rare exception** — `Error`, `NOT FOUND`, `CUSTOM` — and work because you see one
  at a time. A value present on **every** row is metadata: plain text, small, muted, on the name's own
  left margin. Twenty boxed outlines give a column a zigzag edge and no rhythm.
- **Say what it is, or offer to fix it.** A row that can be acted on carries the action (Create
  repository), not a label describing the lack.

**Type size and interface scale**

- **Every type size is `UiFontScale`, and nothing else.** Six tokens — `FontChip`, `FontXs`, `FontSm`,
  `FontMd`, `FontBase`, `FontLg` — each a ratio of the one size the user chose in Settings, written into
  the application's resources by `App.ApplyFontResources` on startup and at every settings change. The
  literal sizes in `AppTheme.axaml` are only what the previewer and a lookup made before that first
  write have to find; `FontScaleTests` fails when they stop matching `UiFontScale.For(AppDefaults.FontSize)`.
- **The typeface ships inside the executable** (`Services/AppFonts.cs`). Six faces of **JetBrains
  Mono** are Avalonia resources compiled into the assembly and registered as a font collection, so
  `AppDefaults.FontFamily` and `AppDefaults.TerminalFontFamily` both begin with
  `fonts:JetBrainsMono#JetBrains Mono` — the one entry in either list that cannot fail to resolve. The
  prefix is the collection's key and is not decoration: a bare "JetBrains Mono" finds the font only on
  a machine that happens to have it installed, which is the whole thing being avoided. The precedent
  is Avalonia's own Inter package, which is registered the same way and still sits behind ours as a
  fallback. **Installing a font instead was the alternative and is worse in every direction**: a
  per-platform installer step, a privilege this application otherwise never wants, and something left
  behind after an uninstall. The interface is monospaced too, deliberately — nearly every string on
  screen here is a path, a branch, a model id or a figure — and it is one settings field away for
  anybody who disagrees. A stored family that is *exactly* one of the old defaults is moved onto the
  new one (`SettingsService.AdoptEmbeddedFont`); anything else is a font somebody chose and is left
  alone. The licence is OFL, which requires the text to travel with the font, so it is in
  `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` — which ships — and the faces sit alone in `Assets/Fonts/JetBrainsMono/`,
  because the collection loads every asset in that directory as a typeface.
- **Two bases, one table.** The same six steps are emitted a second time against
  `AppSettings.TerminalFontSize`, prefixed `Term` (`TermFontBase`, `TermFontSm`, …). The Goal tile and
  its findings dialog use those and nothing else: every row in them is already set in
  `TerminalFontFamily`, and a monospace face at the proportional face's size is what makes two surfaces
  look as though they were set by different hands — Terminal Font Size is where somebody says how big
  they want to read code, and a transcript is code. Emitted at the application level rather than scoped
  to the tile's own tree because **the findings dialog is drawn in the main window**, outside it.
  `FontScaleTests.The_goal_tile_is_sized_by_the_terminal` names both files, the dialog included, since
  that is the half a later view would forget. Not the duplication this section describes above: those
  were one question answered twice, these are two questions — how big is the interface, how big is the
  terminal — sharing one set of steps, so a step cannot mean one thing here and another there.
- **A view may not set a size of its own**, and that is enforced rather than asked for: the same test
  reads every AXAML file and refuses a numeric `FontSize`, a token that is not one of the six, and one
  of the six that nothing uses. There were two families of token before it, both spelled as a
  `DynamicResource` and only one of them alive — the dead one had 136 uses against the live one's 73,
  plus fifteen views that had written a number straight into the markup — so changing the font size
  moved a minority of the interface and nothing on screen said which part. **A new view is written by
  copying an old one, so the guard is the only thing that keeps this true.** The three exceptions are
  named in the test: AvaloniaEdit and the terminal measure a cell grid rather than read a resource, so
  the note, todo and git-diff editors take a number their view model recomputes from the setting.
- **The desktop's text scale is a third question again** (`TextScale`, `DesktopTextScale`). The
  compositor's scale says how dense the display is — Avalonia honours it exactly, fractional
  included. Interface Scale says how much bigger this user wants the whole window than that. The
  text scale says something narrower: that *text* has to be larger, whatever the display is. It is the
  accessibility setting, it multiplies whatever Font Size and Terminal Font Size say, and **nothing in
  Avalonia reads it** — measured against 12.1.2, `Avalonia.FreeDesktop` asks the settings portal for
  the theme variant and the accent colour and nothing else, on every backend. Read from
  `org.gnome.desktop.interface`/`text-scaling-factor` through `gsettings` on Linux (and watched with
  one `gsettings monitor` child for the session, which is both the signal and the new value) and from
  `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Accessibility\TextScaleFactor` on Windows, where **an absent key is the
  normal state and means 100**. Not the portal: its GTK backend answers this key out of the same
  GSettings schema, so it buys no answer this does not already get, at the cost of hand-written D-Bus
  that cannot be exercised from a Windows dev box. Everything about it fails soft and silence is 1.0.
  **The terminal follows too**, which changes the cell grid and reflows the shell — the cost is real,
  and against it is that the terminal is the one surface made entirely of text.
- **A stored font size is read through `TextScale` and never off `AppSettings`**, and that is the same
  enforcement as the markup rule above (`TextScaleTests`, with the four exceptions named and reasoned:
  the two Settings spinners must show what was typed, or typing 14 shows 17.5). Multiplying in
  `ApplyFontResources` alone is the obvious mistake and reintroduces the font-size bug from the other
  end: five tile view models take their size straight from settings, because AvaloniaEdit and the
  terminal measure a cell grid rather than read a resource, so the labels would grow and the terminal,
  the diff, the notes and the database log would not. **A change is announced as an ordinary
  `SettingsChanged`**, because every one of those readers already listens for it and a second event for
  the same question is a second thing to remember to subscribe to.
- **The interface scale is a different question from the font size** (`InterfaceScale`,
  Settings → General → Appearance). The font size moves text and leaves the padding, the icons and the
  gutters where they were; the scale multiplies the whole window at once, through one
  `LayoutTransformControl` in `MainWindow` that everything — the dialogs included — is drawn inside. It
  exists because **on Wayland there is nowhere else to say it**: measured against Avalonia 12.1.2, the
  X11 backend reads `AVALONIA_GLOBAL_SCALE_FACTOR` and the Qt variables beside it and the Wayland
  backend reads none of them. What Wayland does have is `wp_fractional_scale_v1`, which Avalonia
  implements, so the compositor's own scale is already exact — this is the adjustment on top of it, for
  a display where the correct scale is still too small to read. Not Linux-only: a scale that exists on
  one platform is a setting missing on the others, and it costs nothing at 1.0.

**Controls and reuse**

- **A button label is primary text.** `TextSecondary` is the shade for a fact *beside* something; used
  on a control it made every secondary button look disabled — a state those buttons also have and could
  no longer be told apart from. A label on the accent uses `AccentForeground`, picked from the accent's
  own luminance in `ThemeBridge`, because the theme's foreground is chosen to be read on the terminal's
  background and comes out as grey on blue. A control's edge is `BorderStrong`, one step above the card
  it sits on.
- **A heading row's actions go above the list and share one class** (`Button.header-action`: Add,
  Re-detect, Test All, Detect). Below the list, an add button moves every time the list changes length
  and is off screen exactly when the list is long enough for the user to want another entry. Two styles
  side by side read as unrelated controls that happen to be adjacent.
- **An overflow is a second route, not the only one.** What is a button and what is only a menu item
  follows how often it is pressed — a fact about use, not about the code. Restart shell and New session
  were put behind the `…` on the reasoning that they are used "once a session"; they are among the most
  pressed things in the application. Everything in the tile header's button strip is in its menu too, so
  the buttons can stand down at narrow widths (`LeafTileView.ApplyHeaderWidth`) without anything
  becoming unreachable — splits first, because dragging one tile onto another does the same job.
- **A control something is waiting on says so, and says why.** `TileAction.Urgency` is a *sentence*, not
  a flag: the header draws the control in `WarnText` and puts the sentence above the shortcut in its
  tooltip, so a coloured icon is never a mark the user has to guess the meaning of. Offered by the tile,
  which is the only thing that knows — this workspace's skills have moved under a running agent — so a
  kind that grows a reason later is drawn that way without the header learning what the reasons are. It
  is a *second* route to the notice bar and not a replacement: the button stands down below 190px, and
  the bar is what survives that.
- **One writer per property.** A code-behind rule and an `IsVisible` binding both write at the same
  priority, so the last one to fire wins and neither reliably: the tile header's Restart button was
  visible or not depending on whether the tile had been resized or its content had changed more
  recently. Whichever writes it does so alone, and reads the view model itself
  (`LeafTileView.ApplyHeaderWidth`).
- **A modal takes the keyboard when it opens.** Focus the first field, or the first thing a user does
  after asking for a new entry is reach for the mouse.
- **Every answer a dialog offers has a key, and the key is underlined on the button.** Escape cancels
  (once, in `OverlayHost`), Enter presses whatever holds the focus — which in `MessageDialog` is the
  *safe* answer, not the confirming one — and each button answers to the bare letter underlined in its
  own label: `Y`, `N`, `D` for Discard. The letter is **derived from the label**
  (`Views/AccessKeyLabel.cs`, pure and argued in a table test), because `ConfirmAsync` takes both words
  from the caller and today's callers say Discard, Delete, Unload and OK as often as Yes — a fixed
  `Y`/`N` pair would be wrong on half the dialogs. The second button takes the first letter the first
  one left free, since two buttons offering one key is Avalonia cycling between them rather than
  pressing either.
  **The bare letter is refused for `MessageDialog.DefaultSettlingTime` after the dialog opens** — a window each dialog carries as its own, never a static a test moves under the other test classes running beside it. These appear
  *under* somebody's typing — a discard asked for from the git tile, with a terminal a keystroke away —
  so a letter already on its way to the keyboard would answer a question nobody has read. Enter, Escape
  and Alt+letter are aimed at a dialog and work from the first frame; only the one-finger shortcut
  waits. Removing that window is how a stray `D` comes to discard somebody's working tree.
  **The label is an `AccessText` and not a string** (`MessageDialog.Label`), which was measured rather
  than assumed: a `ContentPresenter` turns `"_Yes"` into an `AccessText` only where its template asks
  for it, and Avalonia 12's Fluent Button theme does not — so the string reached the screen as a plain
  `TextBlock` reading `_Yes`, underscore and all, with no access key registered anywhere. The underline
  also shows from the start rather than only while Alt is held, since the bare letter answers too and a
  mark nobody sees is a shortcut nobody knows about.
- **A popup is driven from the keyboard or it is a mouse-only control.** Down steps into the list,
  the arrows browse it, Enter takes the entry and Escape leaves — and a list must not commit on
  `SelectionChanged`, which the arrows raise too: the git tile's commit suggestions did, so the
  first Down key *was* the whole gesture and the list could not be read through at all. A context
  menu built in code gets the platform's own gesture for opening one (the Menu key, Shift+F10) on
  the row that holds the selection, or every action in it needs a mouse.
- **Name a class for what it is, not where it sat.** `add-row` described a button's old position; when
  the position changed the name became a trap for the next reader. It is `choice-row` (a full-width
  option) and `header-action` (something a heading row does to its list).
- **Reuse the class, do not restate it.** `TextBlock.section`, `Button.outlined-sm`, `Border.keycap`,
  `StackPanel.workspace-meta` exist so a heading is a heading everywhere. A local set of font properties
  is a second definition that will drift.
- **Keep the state-carrying control visible; hide the rest.** An overflow `…` takes the once-a-session
  actions; a toggle whose state the header must show (the microphone) stays out of it, because a light
  behind a menu is not a light.
- **A tri-state answer needs three states.** `bool?` where the check is asynchronous, or every item
  asserts the negative until the first pass finishes.
- **Writing to the user's disk asks first**, and an unwired `ConfirmAction` answers **no**.

**Adding an entry to a list opens a form, it does not grow the list.** Three do: the manual database
connection, an agent instance and a provider instance. They share one overlay in `SettingsView`
(`SettingsViewModel.IsEditingAnything`, `CancelEditing`, and `BeginEditing` which puts every other form
down first, or two would be drawn stacked in it), on the same `Border.modal-card` a dialog uses.
As rows they were unusable in a way that only shows at the keyboard: the form is taller than the
viewport, so opening one pushed the list it came from off screen and put Save below the fold. Escape and
the scrim close the form, and only then the dialog — the innermost thing first, or the user cannot tell
which of the two they just cancelled.

## Tiles

Every tile's content implements **`ITile`** (`KindId`, plus change notification and disposal — nothing
else), and announces what it can do by which of eight interfaces extending it it implements: `IBusyTile`
(the workspace row's light — a `TileActivity`, not a flag), `IFileContent` (the file follows the tile's name), `ITileActions`
(the header's buttons and what a paired phone may press), `ITextInputTile` (where a dictated sentence and
an Enter land), `ICustomBackgroundTile` (the terminal's inset and its own background colour), `IProcessTile` (the process
it started, which is what the workspace row's memory reading is measured from), `IDescribedTile` (what
the tile is *running*, beside its name in the header — an agent tile of either kind answers with its instance and model,
and a kind with nothing to add simply does not implement it), `IRemoteViewTile` (what a paired phone
shows when it zooms into the tile, and what the phone may ask of it — the Agent, Goal and terminal tiles). **One class
per kind** — `Services/Tiles/*TileKind.cs` — says what it is called, what it looks like, how it is built
from saved state and what it writes down; **one line per kind** in `App.BuildTileCatalog` registers it
together with the view that draws it, and `LeafTileView` resolves that view by a dictionary lookup on
`KindId` rather than by switching on a view model type. A kind also says **what to call its next tile**
(`NameFor`, numbered by default and an adjective-and-animal for the terminal) and **what to ask before
one exists** (`SetupOptions` — the shell chooser and the agent-instance chooser), so neither the workspace
nor the empty tile branches on which kind it is holding.

`TileContentType` is closed and kept only as the exhaustive record of what is on people's disks:
`TileNode` reads it through `TileKindIds.FromLegacy` and **writes it back beside the new format**, along
with the other old per-kind fields, so an installation Velopack has rolled back still opens its layouts
instead of reading every leaf as an empty tile and saving the emptiness over them on the first splitter
drag. **A layout written before this existed opens unchanged**, and there are five rules and a
golden-file test making that true, including a one-time `{id}.pre-kind.json` copy and a refusal — for the
whole session, on every save, not just the one a migration asks for — to write a layout holding a kind
this build does not know. The dual write is a bridge with an end: when no supported build reads the old
fields, the getters go.

**A tile can take the whole workspace, and five kinds may** (`IMaximizableTile` — terminal, agent, note,
todo, goal). The gesture is a header button that changes shape (`Fullscreen` → `FullscreenExit`, lit while it
is on), Ctrl+Shift+F, an overflow entry, and a **double-click in the empty part of the header** — the
one every window manager already uses for it, guarded so that a button's second press and the name
label's own rename gesture are not it. It is drawn by `TileMaximizeScope` — one per workspace, like
`TileActivationScope` — writing `SplitTileNodeViewModel.Solo` on every split between the root and that
leaf, so each of them draws one child at full size: the same `LeafTileView` and the same
`TerminalControl` the layout already held, because a full-screen view built as a *second* view of the
same tile hands the tile back with an empty shell. **Nothing is persisted and nothing is re-parented**,
and every way out — closing the tile, splitting it, clearing the root — restores first, from a
*remembered* path rather than a re-walked one: each of those leaves the leaf pointing at parents it no
longer has, and a split soloed on an unreachable child is half a workspace invisible for the session.
The goal tile qualifies for the same reason the first four do rather than as an exception: it is a
conversation in one column with nothing docked beside it, so the room buys more transcript — and a plan,
a diff and a review full of file paths are what it has to show in the 300px column a workspace of four
tiles leaves it. The kinds that lay themselves out in panes of their own (git, database, usage)
implement nothing — more room stretches their whitespace and would put a splitter inside a tile with no
splitter around it.

**A tile can be turned into another kind where it stands** (`… → Change type`, built from the same
registry the chooser's cards are). It costs one method — `LeafTileNodeViewModel.ConvertToAsync` — and no
change to the layout format or to `ITileKind`, which is the registry's best argument for itself: one
`Create`, a view resolved by `KindId`, and legacy fields gated by kind. The order is the safety: the new
kind's own setup step is drawn over content that is **still running**, the question (`TileConversion`,
one sentence per kind about what that kind costs) comes after it, and only then is anything destroyed.
The tile keeps its `TileId` — so `agent → note → agent` reopens the same conversation — and loses its
name and the old kind's state. See [`docs/TILES.md`](docs/TILES.md) → *Changing a tile's kind, in place*.

**The window has a tile layout of its own, one level above the workspace's** (`WindowLayoutViewModel`, its catalog `App.BuildWindowTileCatalog`). The same node types, serializer, fixed sides, drag and drop and full-screen scope; a catalog holding only what needs no repository (note, todo, usage); and two **permanent** kinds, the list of workspaces and the place the open workspace is drawn (`ITileKind.IsPermanent`) — never offered by a chooser or Change type, never closable, never convertible, because each is a window with no way back to its workspaces. The list is the one tile with a fixed size, and it depends on the axis (`WindowLayoutViewModel.FixedExtentFor`): as wide as it last was beside the layout, one strip of tabs along it. **One tile in the whole window is active**, at whichever level was last touched (`MainWindowViewModel.ActiveTile`, each level's `TileActivationScope.Deactivate`): that is the tile the dictation shortcut and the phone reach once no text control has the keyboard, and a terminal left behind in a workspace no longer keeps the outline — or the next dictated sentence — while a window note is in use. **A tile put beside the workspaces is narrow** (`WindowTileSize`): 320 px wide or 220 px tall while the window has room for that twice over, 30% of the room otherwise — on a drop at any edge or gutter and on a split from a window tile's header alike, carried as `TileDropSize` (pixels or a share) so a workspace, which asks for neither, keeps the halves and thirds it always had. Its drop hints are the theme's magenta where a workspace's keep their blue (`DropHintBrushes`, `TileDropSurface.HintBrushKey`): the two levels' hints are the same bands drawn over the same screen, and colour is all that says which level a drop goes into. See [`docs/TILES.md`](docs/TILES.md) → *The window's own layout*.

**Restart shell is `IsDestructive`, so it is a header action and not a phone one.** It kills whatever the
shell is running, which is why the header asks first — and a phone that cannot be shown what is about to
die must not be able to press it, confirmation or no (`PhoneTileActions`).

**Everything else is in [`docs/TILES.md`](docs/TILES.md)** — the interfaces and why each earns its place,
the catalog and the one layering boundary it keeps, the persistence format and its migration, tile
actions and the destructive filter that stands between them and a phone. Read it before touching
`ViewModels/ITile*.cs`, `ViewModels/I*Tile.cs`, `Services/Tiles/`, `Models/TileNode.cs` or
`Views/LeafTileView.axaml.cs`.

## Tile activity

What the workspace panel's light is drawn from, and the reason it is a state rather than a flag.
`TileActivity` has **four** members and each of the other three is a lie without the fourth: `Unknown`
is the absence of an answer, which falls through to a lower-ranked source instead of asserting rest —
read as `Idle` it is the failure every screen-reading tool has already paid for, a prompt shape nobody
has a rule for reported as a finished agent. `Blocked` is the state worth acting on: an agent working
is a reason to leave the tile alone, an agent waiting for permission is the one moment somebody has to
come back, and folded into `Working` the list says "something is happening" for both.

**Three layers, ranked, and the higher one silences the lower** (`ActivityAuthority`: `Output` <
`Screen` < `Osc` < `Lifecycle`). Not weighed against each other — a lower source is a worse instrument
measuring the same thing, and letting both speak flickers between them. What each is:

- **`OutputActivitySource`** — the child is writing bytes. Every tile gets it, because it is the one
  source that needs to know nothing about what is running. It **never answers `Idle`**: silence is not
  evidence of rest (a tool waiting on a socket is silent too), so the absence of output expires through
  `ActivityPolicy.FreshnessOf` rather than being asserted. This is the old `OutputActivityLight`, minus
  the deciding.
- **`RecentOutputSource`** — a private 16 KB ring of the child's own bytes with the escape sequences
  taken out (`AnsiText`), matched against that CLI's words. **Recently painted text, not a screen
  snapshot**, and the difference is why it ranks below OSC: text that scrolled away is still in the
  window for a few seconds after it stopped being true. `ActivityMarkers.LastWins` is what survives
  that — the **last** marker painted wins, never "blocked beats working", which gets it backwards
  exactly when it matters and leaves a tile waiting for an answer the user already gave.
- **`TerminalTitleSource`** — OSC 0/2, which `TerminalControl.TitleChanged` has carried all along and
  nothing was reading. The best signal available **without writing a file into anybody's
  configuration**: Claude Code has set an animated title while it thinks since 2.1.6 and re-asserts it
  since 2.1.132, and agy injects a title from its own named `agent_state`.
- **`Lifecycle`** is defined and nothing produces it yet. That rank is where a hook or an event stream
  lands — `claude --settings <generated file>` carrying only a hooks block, `codex -c notify=[…]`,
  opencode's `--port` plus its `/event` stream, a pi extension in a `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` this
  application already owns. All four write nothing into a file the user owns, which is the bar. agy has
  no such route at all (no `--settings`, no `-c`, no directory variable) and says so in its own class.

**`ActivityPolicy` is pure and argued in a table test**, the same construction as `ChainPolicy` and
`UsagePace`. Three rules: rank silences; a reading has a freshness window per authority (a *statement*
outlives a *symptom* by a wide margin, because a statement is not repeated); and the debounce is
**asymmetric** — `Working` immediately, `Idle` only after `IdleConfirmation` holds. That last one is
**not flicker-smoothing**: idle→working is caught reliably and working→idle is the transition that gets
missed, so the state that turns the light *off* is the one that has to be proved. Removing it because
the picture looks steady is what brings back a tile stuck on "working" for the rest of the session —
and it *will* look steady, because the failure is a tile nobody is watching any more.

**The agent says what its own signals mean and learns nothing about arbitration** (`IAiAgent :
IAgentActivityReader` — `ReadTitle`, `ReadRecentOutput`, both `virtual` on `AiAgent` and **never**
default interface members, for the reason `UsesModelContextWindow` spells out). Every table is somebody
else's UI, so every one is pinned by `AgentActivityTests` the way `AiAgentTests` pins the flags.
Measured 2026-09-07 out of the installed binaries: codex 0.153.2 composes its footer at runtime, so
`" to interrupt"` is the whole of the fixed part while its four questions are literals; opencode
1.18.18 renders `busyText ?? "Working..."` and takes its permission buttons from an i18n table, so that
rule **is only right in English** and fails silently everywhere else. Claude Code's table is
second-hand (herdr's published manifest) and its title rule matches a **class of character** — the
braille block U+2800–U+28FF — rather than a phrase, because the spinner is the mechanism and the words
beside it have moved twice. pi and `GenericAgent` answer `Unknown` to both, deliberately, and a test
asserts it so that a table added later is added with a measurement.

**The turning mark is drawn, not lettered** (`Arc.busy-arc` in `Controls.axaml`, worn by the tile header
and by the workspace row). It was `MaterialIconKind.Loading`, whose geometry is a hairline at the 11–13px
it is worn at — a mark you have to go looking for beside a name you are already reading. A `MaterialIcon`
fills a path and has no stroke to thicken, so the only way to give the arc weight at that size is to draw
it. The blocked mark stays a glyph: it is a sign rather than a shape, and it does not turn.

**The tile says it too, in its header's leading slot** (`LeafTileView.UpdateTypeGlyph`). The marks are
the workspace row's — a turning arc while it works, a still `AlertCircleOutline` in `DangerText` while
it waits for an answer, the words in a tooltip from one place (`ActivityDisplay.Tip`) — so the panel and
the tile speak one language, the row saying which workspace and the header which tile. It takes the
kind icon's slot rather than a slot of its own: that slot is already reserved and fixed-width, so
nothing moves and "the name never gives way" costs nothing to keep; the header's buttons stand down as
the tile narrows and a state marker must not; and what it displaces is the one thing on that header
that cannot change while you are looking at it — a tile's kind is said again by its content, its
chooser and its menu, while its activity is said nowhere else on the tile.

**The tile holds one `TileActivityMonitor` and re-exports what it says**, exactly as it held one
`OutputActivityLight`. Which instruments it gets is `TerminalTileViewModel.ConfigureActivity`, virtual,
called from the **first `AttachControl` rather than the constructor** — a virtual call from a base
constructor reaches an override whose own fields are still null, and the terminal agent tile would hand the
title source a null agent. `GoalTileViewModel` implements the interface directly and needs no sources
at all: it *is* the runner, so it answers `Working` while a run is in flight and `Blocked` while a round
of questions or a plan is waiting — the two states it could always have reported and had no way to.

**OSC 9 is done, and it is the one source that needs to know nothing about what is running.** Terminal.Avalonia **0.3.2** reads it (`Terminal.OscDispatch` handles 0, 2, 8, **9**, 52, 10 and 11) and re-exports `Progress`/`ProgressChanged` and `NotificationReceived`. `TerminalProgressSource` maps the report to a state and is added by `TerminalTileViewModel.ConfigureActivity` — so **a plain shell tile gets it too**, which is the point: `npm`, `cargo`, `winget` and Claude Code under `terminalProgressBarEnabled` all report progress, and none of them has a status bar anybody could have written a rule for. Two of the five states answer `Unknown` on purpose: **Error and Warning say what became of the job, not whether the tile is busy** — a tool can report either and carry on, or report either and stop — so they fall through to the output light rather than silencing it. `None` is the one affirmative "finished" and the only report here allowed to put a light out. Ranked with the title (`Osc`) because it is the same kind of evidence, so a tool that sets both behaves as one instrument. **Still unread: the notification half** — `NotificationReceived` carries codex's `agent-turn-complete` toast, which is the only "I have finished" codex emits without a hook, and nothing subscribes to it yet.

## Split tiles architecture

Recursive binary tree: `LeafTileNodeViewModel` (terminal/editor) or `SplitTileNodeViewModel` (H/V + two children). `TileNodeView` manages views manually (not DataTemplate); rebuilding the tree re-parents live terminals with no bracketing, because detaching one does not end its session.

`LeafTileNodeViewModel.IsActive` — `TileActivationScope` (per-workspace instance) guarantees that only one tile is active. `LeafTileView` reacts to `IsActive` — the card's own outline turns `AccentOutline` (`TileCard`) — a muted accent, because the longer the line the quieter it has to be to carry the same weight, and the full accent that suited a 2px strip read as a blue frame once it went all the way round, the toolbar lifts to `BgElevated`, and an inactive tile's header recedes to 0.55 opacity. The outline replaced a 2px strip along the top of the toolbar, which was the right marker for a square tile in a grid of splitters and the wrong one the moment the tile became a rounded card: the radius eats the strip's ends, and what is left is a short line floating inside a corner rather than an edge. The header only — the content of an inactive tile is still being read, and dimming a running terminal because the focus is elsewhere makes every split worse than no split.

**The window is one canvas with cards on it.** `MainWindow` is painted `BgCanvas`; the workspaces panel and every tile are cards on it — same ground, same `RadiusTile`, same `BorderSubtle` hairline — separated by one gutter width, which is `TileNodeView.TileGap` between tiles — the gap between the list and the workspace included, since both are tiles of the window's own layout — and the padding the window's drop surface puts around the outside. That last one is the whole point: without it the outermost ring of cards is cut off by the window frame, and a card clipped by the title bar is not a card. A workspace has no padding of its own any more: its outside gutter is the window's.

**A tile is a card.** `WorkspaceView` is painted `BgCanvas` (below `BgBase`, derived in `ThemeBridge` and going the other way on a light theme, because the canvas is only ever seen in the gaps); `LeafTileView`'s outermost element is a `Border` with `RadiusTile` and a `BorderSubtle` outline, wrapping a second `Border` at `RadiusTileInner` that does the `ClipToBounds`, so nothing inside — a terminal's own background included — has to know the radius. **The two borders are not one border.** `ClipToBounds` on the border that also draws the outline clips to the rounded-down bounds rectangle, so at a fractional desktop scale (125%, 150%) the right and bottom edges fall outside their own clip and the outline renders as an L along the top and left. The panel's card has the same pair for the same reason. `TileNodeView.TileGap` is the canvas showing between two tiles and is the splitter's whole hit area, which is why that splitter carries `GridSplitter.tile-gutter`: transparent and stretched, because the gap *is* the divider and a drawn bar on top of it would be a second one (transparent rather than unset — an unset background is not hit-testable and it would stop being draggable, and a gutter that is not hit-testable is also one nothing can be dropped on). **A class, not the base `GridSplitter` style**, which stays a visible 2px bar: the splitters *inside* tiles — the git tile's list against its diff, the diff view's two editors — sit in `Auto` columns and take their width from it, so making the base style width-less collapsed them to zero and made them impossible to grab.

**A splitter cannot squeeze a tile out of sight** (`TileMinimumSize`, 50px along either axis). The minimum is a property of the whole subtree rather than of the pane being dragged: a star-sized column takes the size the splitter gives it and never grows to what its content needs, so a column squeezed to 50px that holds a further split lays *its* two tiles out past its own edge, under the opaque card next door — the tile is gone, by the route the minimum exists to close. Every leaf along the axis wants its 50px and every split along it also spends a `TileGap`, which is what makes the gutter part of the minimum's arithmetic and not just a look: widening it makes every layout containing a split wider. `TileNodeView.ShowSplit` sets the sum on both definitions and `TileMinimumSize.Fit` scales the pair back proportionally when the grid is narrower than the two together — a floor the layout will not go below does not shrink anything when it does not fit, it pushes the far pane past the edge and clips it, which is the same disappearing tile reached by narrowing the window. The guarantee is about the splitter, not about a window too small to hold the tiles at all. `UpdateSplitRatio` therefore stores the ratio from the definitions' actual sizes, so what is persisted is where the splitter ended up after the minimum had its say.

**A dragged tile has three places to land, and they are ranked**: the workspace's own outer band (a new column or row beside the whole layout), a split's gutter (between the two tiles it holds), and a tile (its edges split it, its middle swaps). The arbitration is `TileDropSurface` and nowhere else — one per tree, the only control in it a tile drag asks, because a tile deciding for itself would have to be overruled afterwards by whatever ranked the three, which is two writers for one hint. **None of the four pieces knows which tree it is in** (`TileTreeEdits` in the view model layer, `TileDropGeometry`, `TileDropSurface`, `TileDragHandle`/`TileDragSession`), and surfaces nest: a surface accepts only a drag whose tile has its own root — read by walking the tile up, never stored — and leaves every other drag unhandled so it bubbles to the surface that owns it. The outer band is 28px and **outranks the tile underneath**, which is forced rather than chosen: a workspace has no padding at all — the gutter round it is the window's — so a band living only in the padding would not exist. **The drag is ours, not the platform's**: `TileDragHandle` captures the pointer and `TileDragSession.Over`/`Drop` hit-test the window and ask the surfaces innermost-first — on Windows `DragDrop.DoDragDropAsync` is an OLE modal loop and lagged well behind the pointer, while a tile never leaves the window. Escape or a lost capture abandons the drag. See [`docs/TILES.md`](docs/TILES.md) → *Where a dragged tile can land*.

**Only a terminal's content is inset from the card** (`ICustomBackgroundTile`, which only `TerminalTileViewModel` implements — the view asks the content rather than testing its type). A terminal is text against an edge and wants the gap; every other tile's content is its own chrome — bars, lists, a composer — and drawing that inside an inset left a square-cornered rectangle floating in a rounded card, with a sliver of card colour round the bottom corners where the two shapes disagreed. Those tiles run to the card's edge and take its corners from `ClipToBounds`.

**The header gives up its split buttons before it gives up the tile's name.** In a `DockPanel` the name gets whatever the docked buttons leave, which in a narrow column was nothing: four tiles in a stack showed a row of icons each and not one name between them. `LeafTileView.ApplyHeaderWidth` stands the two split buttons down below `SplitButtonsNeedWidth`, because closing and the overflow have no other route while a split is also a drag away.

Each tile wears its kind's icon in the header — the same one the empty tile's chooser offers, because both are drawn from the same `ITileKind` — in its `TileAccent*` colour, set from the code-behind because both follow the kind (`Views/TileIcons.cs` maps the kind's `IconId` to a `MaterialIconKind`), and `Views/ModelSearch.cs` is
the matching rule the model fields complete by — every typed word anywhere in the id, in any order, which
is what makes a catalogue of hundreds usable and is an opinion, so it is pure and argued in a table test. Those six accents were raised out of the 40%-lightness band they were picked in: they used to be drawn only as a 3px bar and a 22px chooser icon, and at 13px on `BgElevated` the old values were dark smudges. The header's actions are **buttons *and* menu items**: the `…` overflow holds Restart shell, New session and both splits and never stands down, while the buttons are the fast path and give way as the tile narrows (`ApplyHeaderWidth` — splits at 260px, restart and new session at 190px). Splits go first because dragging a tile onto another does the same job. The microphone is neither: it is a toggle whose state the header has to show, and a light behind a menu is not a light.

`TileActivationScope.SuppressActivation()` — guard (IDisposable) blocking the GotFocus → Activate cascade during programmatic Focus() and Rebuild. Used in `LeafTileView.FocusContent()` and `TileNodeView.Rebuild()`.

## Tile ID

Each tile has a persistent `TileId` (`Guid.NewGuid().ToString()`, hyphenated format). Generated on creation, saved in `TileNode.TileId` in workspace JSON. Propagated to `TerminalTileViewModel.TileId`.

In startup script `${tileId}` is replaced with the current `TileId` — both on first launch and on restart.

## Terminal key handling

`TerminalClipboardCoordinator` (static, window-level) handles **Ctrl+C / Ctrl+Shift+C** copy across all tiles: a single tunnel KeyDown handler on `MainWindow` copies from whichever terminal holds a selection (focused first → most recent selection owner, tracked via the control's `SelectionChanged` → any live terminal from the weak registry). Without a selection Ctrl+C falls through and keeps SIGINT semantics. Text-editing controls (TextBox, AvaloniaEdit) are never hijacked. Terminals register in `TerminalTileView` right after construction and unregister in `TerminalTileViewModel.Dispose`. Ctrl+C is marked handled only if the copy succeeded — a refused clipboard must not cost the user the interrupt as well.

**Ctrl+V** is handled by the control: clipboard **text** is pasted (filtered, bracketed when the app asked for it). **Ctrl+Shift+V** / **Shift+Insert** paste as well. **Alt+key** and everything else travel as win32 INPUT_RECORDs whenever the child enabled `?9001` (PSReadLine does, for every prompt).

**Image paste into a TUI** works through `ForwardCtrlVWhenClipboardHasNoText = true` (set in `TerminalTileView`): the control pastes text when there is text, and otherwise sends the Ctrl+V keystroke on to the child, so Claude Code reads the image off the clipboard itself. The control's default is off (Windows Terminal parity); this app opts in because hosting AI agents is what it is for.

**On Linux that last step is a separate program, and its absence is silent at every layer** (`Services/ClipboardHelpers.cs`). Measured 2026-09-12 against Claude Code 2.1.269 and opencode 1.18.18: neither carries a clipboard of its own there, so both shell out — `xclip -selection clipboard -t image/png -o` and `wl-paste --type image/png`, each as the other's fallback, after a check of the same shape. With neither installed the check exits non-zero, Claude Code returns `null`, opencode gets an empty buffer, **and nothing anywhere says so** — our own log writes `clipboard has no text (forwarding key: True)`, which is this application reporting success. So the keystroke that arrived correctly and the feature that did nothing look identical, and the only place the cause can be named is before the paste: the Arch package depends on `wl-clipboard` and `xclip` outright, and everywhere else Settings → AI carries one sentence above the lists and an **Install…** button that goes through `InstallPlan` like any other. The check is `PATH` and not `ExecutableFinder.Anywhere` on purpose — what matters is what the *child* will find, and a child inherits exactly our `PATH`. **It asks for the program this session can actually use, never for either of the two**: `wl-paste` talks to a compositor and `xclip` to an X server, so an X11 machine carrying only `wl-clipboard` has one on `PATH` that reaches nothing — accepting either left exactly that machine with no sentence, no button and a screenshot the agent never gets. The session is read from `XDG_SESSION_TYPE` first and from `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`/`DISPLAY` where no login manager set one, `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` outranking `DISPLAY` because XWayland sets both; a session that names neither is the third answer, where either program is still enough, since withholding the clipboard from a machine whose agent can reach it is the same mistake facing the other way.

**Text wins when the clipboard holds both.** A copy from a browser or a screenshot tool often puts text *and* an image on the clipboard; the rule above asks only about text, so the text is pasted and the agent never gets the chance to take the image. Deliberate — the alternative is guessing which one the user meant — and **Alt+V** is the way past it, which the control never intercepts and so sends on as `ESC v`.

**That escape hatch is Windows and WSL only, and it is Claude Code's own keymap that decides.** Measured 2026-09-12 against 2.1.269, which reads the platform once and binds accordingly — `alt+v` on those two, `ctrl+v` on every other — so on Linux and macOS the `ESC v` we take such care to pass through arrives at a key nothing is bound to. There is no second gesture there: a screenshot copied with the words beside it cannot be handed to the agent at all, and what works instead is copying the picture on its own. **The Goal tile's composer is the exception and always was** — its Alt+V is *ours*, read off Avalonia's clipboard in `GoalTileView`, so that one works wherever the application does.

### One thing the old control did and this one does not

**A left-drag no longer always selects locally.** mTiles used to set `SelectionOverridesMouseTracking`; `Terminal.Avalonia` rejects a one-way override (see its `docs/MTERMINAL-COMPAT.md` → *Deliberately not adopted*) because it leaves an application with no way to receive the mouse at all — mc, vim, opencode click targets. Inside a full-screen app that grabbed the mouse, selection now needs **Shift** held: the xterm convention, but a habit users have to learn. Recorded so nobody rediscovers it as a bug.

**Drop from the system** (`Views/ImageDrop.cs`): a no-drop cursor and no `[ImageDrop] Dropped on` line in the log mean Windows never delivered the drag — the process is elevated (UIPI, e.g. Rider as admin). Not fixable in code.

## Alt-buffer cleanup (TUI apps)

Handled by the control, no app-side code: leaving the alternate screen releases the mouse grab, and **Shift** overrides a grab that is still latched. A TUI killed with Ctrl+C therefore no longer floods the shell with SGR mouse sequences.

## ThemeBridge — UI synchronization with terminal theme

`ThemeBridge.Apply(TerminalTheme)` in `App.axaml.cs` dynamically derives UI colors (backgrounds, borders, text, accents) from the active terminal theme. Dark/Light mode is derived from `TerminalTheme.IsDark` — no separate theme selector. Called on startup and on every `SettingsChanged`. Thanks to `DynamicResource` the entire UI reacts immediately to theme changes.

## The launch chain

**Shell profiles are gone.** A profile was a name, a shell, a startup script, a fallback and a required
AI binary — everything an AI CLI needed, written out by hand in Settings and kept working by hand. Those
are the agent's own business now (`Services/Agents/`), so a terminal tile is a shell and nothing else,
and the Settings dialog has neither a Profiles tab nor an AI Tools one. What is left of a profile on
disk is read by exactly one thing: `TerminalAgentTileMigration` matches a saved leaf's `userProfileId` against
`AppSettings.ShellProfiles` to work out which of somebody's terminal tiles were an AI CLI in a shell, and
turns those into terminal agent tiles. **Nothing seeds, edits or deletes a profile**, which is why the key is
still in the settings file — clearing it would take the migration's evidence with it, a launch before the
workspace holding those tiles is even opened. Both go a release from now.

The chain itself stayed, because it is what makes a terminal agent tile survive its CLI crashing.

**DirectLaunchSession** (`Services/DirectLaunchSession.cs`): when a profile has `FallbackScript` → `LaunchScripts.RunsCommandChain` is true. Commands are run via `shell -c "command"` (not interactively). Chain: startup → fallback → plain interactive shell. Each command is started and then **awaited to its end** (`TerminalControl.WhenSessionEndedAsync(sessionId)`), so the verdict is the **exit code plus how long it ran** — there is no "it survived N seconds, so it worked" window any more:

| Outcome | Meaning | What the chain does |
|---|---|---|
| spawn throws | tool not installed, bad cwd | next command |
| non-zero, ran < `Established` (2 min) | the command does not work | **next** command — never the same one |
| non-zero, ran ≥ `Established` | a working tool crashed | **same** command again |
| exit 0, ran ≥ `MinLifetimeForRelaunch` (10s) | the user quit the tool | whole chain from the start |
| exit 0, ran < 10s | it did not stick | **next** command (the fallback is what an agent names for this) |
| no exit code at all | connection lost | as non-zero |

Every relaunch is rate-limited **for the chain as a whole**, systemd-style: at most **3 in 10 minutes** (`RelaunchBudget`), after which the chain carries on to the next command instead. One relaunch is free: a **clean** exit after at least `Established` is the user closing their tool on purpose, and quitting it four times in a morning must not have the tile refuse to bring it back (`CountsAgainstBudget`). A rate over a window, not a running total — a total would give up on a tool used daily once its fourth crash came round, however many months apart the four were. Chain-wide, not per command, and that part is structural: a per-command budget was renewed every time the chain moved on, so a chain whose fallback exits cleanly looped forever between fallback and top, renewing its budget on each lap. Nothing resets this but time.

The rules live in `ChainPolicy` (thresholds + `Decide` + `CountsAgainstBudget`), separate from the chain that carries them out and pure, so they are readable in a table test without a terminal, a dispatcher or a stopwatch. The lifetime is **not** measured by the host: `SessionExitedEventArgs.Lifetime` comes from the terminal, which stamps the session when it spawns the child — timing it around the host's own `await` measures the wait instead.

One loop is deliberately unbounded: a command that exits **cleanly** after `Established`, for ever, is restarted for ever. Every lap costs at least two minutes of a real session, so it is not a spin, and it is indistinguishable from a user quitting and reopening their tool by hand — bounding it would stop the tile honouring the very gesture it exists to honour.

Off the end of the chain is the interactive shell, which is not watched, so a tile is never left dead. Both thresholds are load-bearing: judging on time alone made `claude -r <unknown-id>` (**21 s** to print "Invalid session ID" and exit 1) look adopted, read its failure as the user quitting, and relaunch it every 21 s for good with the fallback unreachable — while judging on the code alone would demote a tile permanently to a bare shell the first time a long-running tool crashed. Without `FallbackScript` → classic mode: shell starts interactively with the startup script as the session's startup input.

`LaunchScripts` (returned by `TerminalTileViewModel.ResolveCurrentScripts`) decides which of the two paths a tile takes. `RunsCommandChain` is true exactly when `Fallback` is non-blank — something that names a fallback is something that launches commands. It was a stored third value every caller computed the same way, so the type could hold combinations nothing can produce; deriving it also removed a dead disjunct (`Startup is not null || …`) that made the rule look like it had two halves. Blank is normalised to null in the `init` setters, so `with` cannot slip a script of spaces past it.

The instance **owns** the tile's chain: it relaunches only the session whose `SessionId` it started (taken from `RestartAsync`, which returns it — reading `SessionId` afterwards can describe a session someone else opened), and whoever replaces the chain (restart, tile close) disposes it first — `TerminalTileViewModel.ReplaceLaunchSession`, which owns that invariant so no caller can break it. Without both, a restart leaves two chains fighting over one tile and closing a tile resurrects its shell as an orphan process.

Tile creation flow:
1. Empty tile → click Terminal → if this machine has more than one shell, the kind's own setup step appears (Back / Default shell / one card per detected shell). Click Agent and the step lists the configured instances this machine can run. Both steps are `ITileKind.SetupOptions`, not something the empty tile knows about terminals or agents
2. The choice → `TerminalTileKind.Create(context, { "shellName": … })` or `TerminalAgentTileKind.Create(context, { "agentInstanceId": …, "agentId": … })`. **The same call a saved layout makes** — choosing *is* handing a new tile its initial state
3. `TileLauncher.Launch` → `LaunchScripts.RunsCommandChain` → `DirectLaunchSession.Start()`, else → `ShellStarter.StartAsync()` with the startup script

### Session resume

A tile's `TileId` is the agent's session id, so a restart reopens the same conversation. **Claude Code** and **pi** take an id outright, so `IAiAgent.SessionIdForTile` hands the tile's own id straight through — pi through `--session-id`, which creates and resumes alike, and Claude Code through `--resume <id>` with `--session-id <id>` as the fallback: measured on 2.1.251 the creating flag refuses an id already in use, so leading with it meant every launch after the first fell through to a fallback carrying no id at all.

**OpenCode cannot be told one**: `opencode --session <id>` only ever *continues* a session (unknown id → `Session not found`, exit 1 after ~1.4 s, which the chain reads as "next command"), and the TUI creates no session at all until the first message — so there is nothing to observe at startup and pick up either. The way in is `opencode import`, which takes a JSON document and keeps its `id` verbatim; `ses_${tileId}` is legal, so no tile→session map exists anywhere. `OpenCodeSession` writes that document, `TileScript` expands `${opencodeSessionFile}` to its path (a pure function of the tile id, so the launcher can ask whether a script refers to one without writing anything), `TileLauncher` writes it before either launch path runs, and `OpenCodeAgent.Resume` answers `opencode --session ses_<tileId>` falling back to `opencode import "${opencodeSessionFile}" ; opencode --session ses_<tileId>`.

Measured against **opencode 1.18.14**, all load-bearing: the document's `projectID`/`directory` are **ignored** — the session lands in the project of the import's *cwd*, which is why the import runs as one of the tile's own commands; re-importing an existing id is **non-destructive** (title and messages kept), which makes it create-if-missing rather than a way to wipe the conversation being resumed; **every** field is required (`id`+`time` alone is rejected with `Missing key`, which does not say which key); `version` is not validated. It is opencode's *export* format, not an API — when it moves, the import fails, the resume finds nothing, and the chain ends at an interactive shell: a tile without its history rather than no tile. `OpenCodeSessionTests` pins the shape so that surfaces as a failing build.

The commands are the agent's own, so a user who had the old (never-working) seeded profile gets the fix by their tile becoming a terminal agent tile — there is nothing left to migrate a script into.

**Codex** and **agy** name their own session; see `SessionStrategy.CapturedAfterStart` under *Agents*.

Shell persistence in layout: the tile's state carries `shellName`, and `TerminalTileKind.Create` resolves it through `ShellTerminalCatalog`. A shell that is no longer installed falls through to the default.

## Settings UI

Settings dialog as a modal overlay with responsive sizing (50% window width / 80% window height, min 420×400). Four tabs:
- **General** — Default Shell, Appearance (color theme, font), Terminal (font), and the settings file
  itself: **Export** and **Import** (`SettingsPortability`). On this tab rather than a page of its own
  because what it carries is the whole dialog. **Secrets do not travel unless a passphrase says they
  may** — with none, every field encrypted at rest is written out empty, since a DPAPI blob is bound to
  this user on this machine and would not work anywhere else, and the alternative is plain-text keys in
  a file somebody is about to share. A passphrase, asked for before the save dialog (empty keeps that
  old behaviour), puts the secrets into one `SecretVault` property *beside* the settings rather than
  inside them (`PassphraseVault`: PBKDF2-SHA256 into AES-256-GCM, cost parameters written into the
  file), so a vault file still opens in a build that knows nothing of vaults; and the confirmation
  names which of the two files is about to be written — the two warnings are constants on
  `SettingsPortability` for exactly that reason, and the `ExtraEnv` sentence is in both, because it is
  the one part true either way. An import that reads a vault asks once for the passphrase and stops
  otherwise — a wrong one is named a wrong passphrase, not a corrupt file (`ExportProtection.Check`
  carries a known plaintext for that question) — and a secret that will not decrypt arrives empty,
  which `SettingsService.KeepExistingSecrets` reads as *the file said nothing*, so the value already
  on this machine survives. An import is a replacement rather than a merge — a mixture
  nobody chose is worse — except that `SettingsService.Replace` **keeps every secret already set up
  here**, matched by id (provider keys *and* manual database connection passwords, one restore for each
  field the export blanks, or a file exported from this machine and imported back into it would empty
  half of them): a file meant to add configuration must not remove the one part of it nobody can retype
  from memory. `Replace` also runs the **same seeding and legacy migration the constructor does** — an
  imported file can be older than this build, and an agent it has never heard of would otherwise have no
  instance at all until the next restart, missing from both choosers with nothing on screen saying why.
  Afterwards `ReloadFromSettings` puts **every** page back in step, not the three the import obviously
  touches: the other pages save as you type, so a Speech tab still showing the old shortcut writes it
  straight back over the imported one the first time any control on it is touched, and nothing on screen
  says that happened. Speech, Phone and the default shell reload through the same methods the
  constructor uses — which write the backing *fields*, so the notification is raised once, for
  everything, rather than as a hand-kept list of two dozen property names
- **AI** — the agent instances a tile can be created from and the providers they authenticate through.
  An agent row carries its name, its CLI, a `NOT INSTALLED` chip and, when an `InstallPlan` exists,
  **Install…** — which shows the command, then runs it **in the background** through
  `BackgroundInstaller` (no shell, no tile; a line above the lists while it runs, the installer's last
  lines in a dialog if it fails — see *Where AI tools went*). Only a plan that `NeedsATerminal` (a
  sign-in, or a package install that asks for a password) still opens a terminal tile, through
  `TerminalTileKind.StartupScriptKey`, consumed at the first launch. A provider row is edited on the same overlay the manual database connection
  uses, with Test (`IAiProvider.TestAsync`), Models and — for a local server — Discover
  (`LocalProviderDiscovery`, on demand, network sweep opt-in). The model field is an `AutoCompleteBox`
  over the provider's own list rather than a combo box, because that list runs to hundreds. The agent
  form's account chooser is an `AccountChoice` (kind, id **and** label), never the label alone: nothing makes
  an instance's name unique — a new one is seeded with the provider's own display name — so two keys for
  the same service, which is the case several instances exist for, are two identically spelled rows, and
  a chooser keyed by name saved and reopened as the first of them, authenticating the agent as the wrong
  account. **The chooser holds only the providers that agent can speak to** (`AiProviderCatalog.IsCompatible`,
  rebuilt when the agent changes, and it drops a selection the new agent cannot use): a pairing stored
  here makes the instance unavailable everywhere — `AiAgentCatalog.IsAvailable` refuses it, so it is gone
  from the Agent tile's chooser and from the Goal tile's list — and the row is the only place that can
  say why, which is what its `UNAVAILABLE` chip is for — one sentence from `AgentAvailability`, the same
  rule the choosers hide on, so what is hidden and what is explained cannot drift apart. The effort chooser is the same idea one level
  down: the agent's own `SupportedEfforts` narrowed by the chosen model's (`NarrowEfforts`, fed by the
  models fetched for the chosen account), and a level neither accepts falls back to the tool's own
  default.
  **The agent rows can be dragged into another order** (`Views/ListReorder.cs`, `SettingsViewModel.MoveAgentInstance`), and that order is the one every chooser lists them in. **`bypass` asks once before it is stored here too**, and an unwired `ConfirmAction` answers no
  **Under the two model fields, what the provider says about the model, said in tokens.** The Model and
  Fast model fields each show `N tokens context` as soon as the chosen model is one the account
  describes — answered free from the list already fetched (OpenRouter, LM Studio), or, for a model the
  list does not describe (Ollama's naming is all it does), by one debounced per-model call. **The
  readouts race the form**, and every path through the lookup cancels the one in flight first — a
  cleared field, an answer straight off the list, a newer keystroke — because the one that answers
  after the field moved on would otherwise pass the cancellation test and write its number under a
  question nobody is asking any more. The **Auto-compact** field is Claude Code's only (hidden on the
  other five, which read none of this) and is the manual `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW`: empty is
  the fallback for the launch to work out from the model's context (see `ModelContextWindow`), typed is
  a decision and is handed over unchanged.
  A third list, **Sign-ins**, is the CLI's own logins — a second subscription and a third. A row asks
  for one thing, what you call it; saving makes the directory and **Sign in** shows what will run and
  then opens a tile with the agent's environment already set, where the user runs the tool's own login
  command. It asks the way an install asks, and for a reason beyond symmetry: the sentence naming the
  login command is in the plan's note, the route a plan takes to a tile carries the command alone, and
  without the question that note was built and thrown away — leaving a tile with the environment set, an
  empty prompt, and a row still saying "not signed in". That command goes
  through the *startup script* rather than the process environment, which is the opposite of what a
  launch does and deliberately: the rule exists because a script lands in the scrollback and the shell's
  history, which is fatal for a key and harmless for a directory the user just named. It reaches the tile
  through `InstallCommand.For` — the tile route only a plan that `NeedsATerminal` takes (an install runs in the background), and **not** `InstallPlan.CommandLine`,
  whose quoting is for reading: every part of a shell line has a space in it, so the tile was handed the
  whole command inside quotes and printed it instead of running it, while the row went on saying "not
  signed in". The row's status
  is **read from the CLI's own files every time the page loads** (`SignInStatus`, and for Claude Code
  the address and plan out of `.claude.json`/`.credentials.json`, never the token) — a remembered
  "signed in" keeps saying so after a logout in a terminal. Those reads are **walked, not parsed**
  (`AiAgent.ReadJsonString`): `.claude.json` carries a Claude Code installation's per-project history
  and grows into the megabytes, and the read runs on the UI thread once per sign-in row and once per
  account-chooser rebuild — a DOM of the whole file is more than naming who a row belongs to may cost,
  so the reader stops at the answer and everything else is skipped token by token. The section hides itself where no
  installed agent supports one — unless sign-ins already exist, which stay reachable, so a CLI dropping
  off `PATH` cannot strand rows nobody can then rename or remove. The agent form's **Provider** field is now **Account** and holds both
  kinds, because they are one question. **There is no List button**: the model list is fetched when the
  account changes, which is the one event that changes the answer, and a subscription simply fetches
  nothing — it has no catalogue to ask. The field narrows by every typed word in any order
  (`Views/ModelSearch.cs`), because an id is punctuated by whoever published it and the separator is the
  part nobody remembers.
- **Database** — enable service, HTTP port, SQL Server/PostgreSQL credentials, scan interval, manual
  connections with their own **Export/Import** on the heading row (`ManualConnectionsPortability`)
- **Speech** — dictation on/off, shortcut (captured by pressing it), push-to-talk vs toggle, microphone,
  language, auto-Enter, vocabulary, and the model list with download/delete and progress; plus a **Phone**
  section (keep the link connected, and the phone's own auto-Enter). The bridge reacts only to the first
  of those changing — it starts or stops the link — and reads auto-Enter afresh at every sentence

`SettingsViewModel.SelectedTab` controls tab visibility, and the pages are named in `ViewModels/SettingsTabs.cs` (`General`, `Ai`, `Database`, `Speech`) — used by the view model, by the database tile's "open my settings" button, and from XAML through `{x:Static vm:SettingsTabs.…}`, which replaced the `Zero`…`Four` boxed-int resources. Constants rather than an enum: the selection is bound as an `int` to command parameters in two AXAML files, and the numbers were the problem, not the type. The Database tab has its own sub-tabs (`DbSubTabs`: `Config`, `Discovered`, `Manual` — named for the
reason `SettingsTabs` is, and three rather than two because a scan's output and something the user typed
answer different questions: the discovered list rewrites itself and nothing on it is anybody's work,
while a manual connection has a password in it and is the only route to a database the scan cannot
reach. On one page the typed rows sat above a list that changes on its own, and the two heading actions
— Add and Rescan — read as alternatives to each other). Tab button styles: `settings-tab` / `settings-tab-active` in `Controls.axaml`; a bordered button on a settings row is `outlined-sm` there, not ten inline properties. The boxed `Zero`/`One` integer resources are gone with the last binding that used them — the database tile's own Config/Logs strip passes `"0"`/`"1"` as strings, and every named tab is a constant.

**The database form is the only one that is not saved as you type**, because applying it restarts the database service. `SettingsView` is therefore a `DockPanel` with a pinned Save & Apply bar at the bottom and the `ScrollViewer` *inside* it — docking to the bottom within a scroller pins to the bottom of the content, which is no pinning at all. The bar shows whenever `HasUnsavedDatabaseChanges`, which compares the form against the stored settings rather than remembering that something was typed, so undoing an edit puts it away.

Leaving the tab does not discard the edits, and closing the dialog (button, Escape, click outside — all through `MainWindowViewModel.CloseSettingsAsync`) or the application (`ConfirmShutdownAsync`) asks first. Answering yes discards; answering no reopens the dialog on the Database tab, because "you have unsaved changes" is no use without showing which.

## Where AI tools went

There is no AI Tools tab and no `AiToolDetector`. What that table could say about a CLI was whether it
was installed and what `--version` printed, which is not enough to launch one: an agent has to know how
to resume its own conversation, which flags mean "read-only" here and how to read what comes back, and
none of that can be written into a row of a settings grid. So it is a class (`Services/Agents/`), the
list of them is closed, and what the user configures is an **instance** of one.

**A new agent class carries its own front door: `InstallUrl` and `InstallPlan`.** Both live on the
agent, never on the instance. `InstallUrl` is the tool's own page — the Settings AI row renders it as a
link that opens the browser. `InstallPlan` is the install command, offered by the row's **Install…**
button only while the CLI is not on this machine (`CanBeInstalled`), shown to the user before it runs,
and then run **in the background** — `Services/BackgroundInstaller.cs`, the plan's argv started as a
process of this application's own, no shell and no tile. That is a reversal: it ran in a visible tile,
on the reasoning that something writing outside our directories must be watched. What the tile was
actually carrying, and where each half went, is in ADR
[0005](docs/adr/0005-an-output-proxy-per-agent-instance.md) → *Amendment*: the confirmation is still the
place the command is read; the questions an installer would have asked are answered in the plan
(`--accept-source-agreements` and friends) with `BackgroundInstaller.Timeout` killing what still hangs;
and the installer's own output is captured from both streams, logged whole, and its last lines carried
into the failure dialog, since with no tile that is the only account of what happened. **No shell is
what fixes the other half**: `IShellTerminal.Program` hands a resolved path to PowerShell alone and
every other shell keeps the bare name — right for a per-directory shim, wrong for an installer whose
binary is not on `PATH` at all. **A sign-in is not an install and keeps its tile**
(`InstallPlan.NeedsATerminal`): a login only *starts* at the command and then waits for the user, so in
the background it is a process hung on a prompt nobody can see. One install at a time for the whole
page, with a line above the lists saying which. Leaving either null hides that agent's link or
button and is a decision, not an omission.

Two pieces of the old code were kept because the mechanism was right: `ExecutableFinder.Anywhere` is its
scan of `PATH` and the handful of places a global npm, go or cargo install puts a binary — a GUI process
does not inherit the `PATH` a login shell builds — and `AiAgentCatalog.Locate` holds that answer for
thirty seconds, which is the same window the table's own detection cache had.

## Agent conversation tile

**Agent** (kind id `agent-conversation`) holds an AI agent as a conversation drawn by this application:
messages, every tool call as a row, work between two messages folded into one group once it finishes,
approvals and questions as blocks at the end, the agent's plan, the context used, and a diff with **Undo
changes** for every turn that changed files. **Terminal agent** (kind id `agent`, unchanged — renamed on
screen only, and its tiles keep their `Agent#n` names) is still the agent's TUI in a terminal. Ported from
t3code, which drives every agent through a structured protocol.

Three rules: **the events are the contract** (`mTiles.AgentSessions.Events` — nothing about any CLI in
them, serialized with a `type` discriminator so a browser can read them as they are); **differences live
in the agent's class** (`IConversationalAgent.CreateSession`, one folder per agent under
`Services/Agents/Sessions/`); **what is drawn is always recomputed** (the SQLite store keeps events and
`ConversationReducer`, pure, replays them). `AgentConversationHost` is the one entry point every viewer
uses: it numbers and stores events, records the user's message itself, brackets each turn with two git
checkpoints and keeps the resume token beside the conversation.

**A tile can be pointed at any conversation it has held in this workspace** (`IConversationStore.List`, the
chooser in the strip's right-hand corner, holding conversations only, `ConversationTitle` for what a row is called). The conversation is a
`conversationId` in the layout **written only once one has been chosen** — absent means the tile's own id,
so a layout from before this opens exactly what it always did — rather than a change of `TileId`, which is
the tile's identity to the layout and would let two leaves be saved under one id. Consequences worth
knowing: **"New conversation" no longer forgets and always asks** (a button in the tile's header — `INewConversationTile`, which the Goal tile answers too as "New goal" — not a row in the list; it opens one beside the old, and *Delete this
conversation* is what takes it), **a conversation is one tile's at a time** (`OpenConversations` — two hosts
of one conversation number their events from the same starting point and the store keeps whichever landed
last), and **the agent comes with the conversation** rather than the other way round, because a resume token
is only ever handed back to the CLI that issued it — which is also why picking *another* agent is a
**handover** rather than a switch (below). What the picker cannot promise is that the *agent*
remembers what the transcript shows — but it can promise to **say so** when it does not: pi and agy used to
fail a cold resume in silence, and both are now caught before the first message (`ResumeCheck` — pi's
`get_state` `messageCount`, agy's `init` naming another id; measured live 2026-09-17), while Grok 1.0.34
answers an unknown id with an error. The table is in
[`docs/AGENT-CONVERSATIONS.md`](docs/AGENT-CONVERSATIONS.md) → *Which conversation a tile is showing*.

**The chooser leaves out an agent whose CLI is not installed** (the tile's own instance excepted), as the Terminal agent and Goal tiles do. **Another agent is picked, and the work is handed to it.** No CLI can continue another's session, and that
was read for a long time as a refusal: another agent was offered dimmed, with a sentence saying to start a
new conversation. Right about the mechanism, wrong about the user — the transcript is ours and the working
tree is on disk, so the *work* moves perfectly well even though the session cannot. What travels is a brief
folded out of what this application already recorded (`ConversationHandover`, pure, in
`mTiles.AgentSessions`): the first message verbatim, the answered rounds of questions, the plan with its
statuses, the files each turn changed — minus any turn that was undone, since those edits are not in the
tree — and where it stopped, fitted to a budget that drops the middle of the work oldest-first and **says
how much it dropped**, since a brief that quietly loses the middle reads as a complete account of a smaller
task. Nothing is asked of any CLI for it, which is what makes a handover possible when the outgoing agent
has crashed — the usual reason somebody switches. The seam is written between the two hosts
(`HandoverWriter`, called with the old host disposed and the new one not yet built): the record moves onto
the new agent, `HandoverRecorded(From, To, Brief)` is appended, and **the resume token is cleared** — the
half that costs a conversation if it is wrong, because `codex resume <unknown>` opens an interactive picker
a launch waits on for ever and `agy --conversation <unknown>` warns, starts a *new* conversation and exits
0, so the tile cannot tell a resumed session from a lost one. The brief is then **sent rather than recorded
as a message** (`SendMessage(Recorded: false)`, its one caller): the timeline already carries it, folded, on
the handover entry, and written again as something the user said it would stand above the new agent's first
answer as their own words. **The mode and the effort travel, the model does not** — they are this
application's own canonical scale and `AiProcessRunner.Fit` already narrows them to the arriving agent's
lists at every launch, while a model is spelled for the provider behind the account that is leaving;
dropped instead, a switch quietly put somebody working in `bypass` back on the tool's own asking, which is
a change of permissions nobody was told about, so bypass travels too and the confirmation says so in a
sentence of its own. **Undo changes still works across the seam**, because `ITurnCheckpoints` is keyed by
the conversation and knows nothing of agents — the working tree is the shared state. The one refusal left
is `RefusalFor`'s: an agent this machine cannot run has nothing to hand the work to.

**The switch asks three ways, not two** (`ChooseHandover`, `HandoverAnswer`, `MessageDialog.ChooseAsync`):
carry the context over (the brief above), switch **without** it — the seam is still written, since it is what
moves the record and clears the token, but with an empty brief that `BriefOwedIn` never sends — or stay.

**A terminal agent tile asks the same question** when Run as or Change type moves it to another CLI or another
login (`LeafTileNodeViewModel.AskAboutSwitchingAsync`). Its brief comes out of the CLI's own transcript
(`IAgentSessionLog.ReadTranscriptAsync`, measured for Claude Code and codex only — the rest answer
`ReadsTranscripts` false and get the plain confirmation), folded by `TerminalHandover` into
`.mtiles/handover/*.md`, and the arriving agent is pointed at it by **one typed line** (`HandoverDelivery`) —
typed rather than put on the command line, because the launch chain reruns its commands and would hand the
brief over again at every relaunch.

**A conversation remembers which account each stretch of it ran as, and says so.** The agent is only half
the identity: a resume token lives in the *account's* own directory, so the same CLI on a second
subscription starts cold while the transcript — which is ours — goes on being drawn as one unbroken column.
Four halves of that were silent and are not now. `SessionConfigured` carries a **`SessionAccount`** (agent,
instance, the instance's name, sign-in), **stamped by the host and never reported by the session** — a
session says what its CLI told it, and only the host knows the row in Settings it was launched from, which
is the thing that decides where the token lives; `ConversationReducer` carries it forward and marks **every
timeline entry** with it in `Append`, the one place an entry is made, so an old conversation needs no
migration and reads back with nulls. Opening a conversation puts the tile back on that account and on its
model, mode and effort (`AdoptStoredSession`) — the record names only the agent, so a tile used to take
whichever instance of it came first, which on a machine with two subscriptions is a coin toss; the model
comes back **through `IAiAgent.InstanceModel`**, the round trip a model picked in the strip already takes,
since what a session lists is spelled that CLI's way and opencode and pi would otherwise qualify it a second
time into `openrouter/openrouter/auto`. The first entry of a new stretch carries a
rule with the account's name on it (`TimelineItemViewModel.Seam`, `MarkSeams`), drawn on the *item* rather
than as an item of its own because `TimelineSync` matches view models to records by position. And **another login of the same agent is a handover**, exactly as another agent is
(`MovesTheLogin`, feeding `ApplySwitchAsync`'s `handingOver`): the brief is written and sent and the token
cleared, because the arriving session could resume nothing — it used to start cold under a transcript the
model had never seen, with a warning (`ConfirmLeavingTheAccountAsync`, now asked only before anything has
been said, where there is no work to brief) as the whole of the answer.

**A sub-agent working is work, turn or no turn** (`SubAgentStarted`/`SubAgentProgressed`/`SubAgentEnded`,
`ConversationState.IsBusy`). A background sub-agent outlives the turn that launched it — Claude Code answers
the `Agent` call "launched" at once and ends the turn, a codex sub-agent is a thread of its own — and the
tile used to go quiet with it: no spinner, Stop turned back into Send, and the agent's own answer later
arrived in a turn nothing had opened. `IsWorking` is still "a turn is open" and decides Send against Stop;
`IsBusy` is what the spinner, Escape, the tile's activity and every restart follow, and a turn's end leaves
a background sub-agent and what it is asking alone. A turn the agent opens by itself is opened for it. The
measurements are in [`docs/AGENT-CONVERSATIONS.md`](docs/AGENT-CONVERSATIONS.md) → *Sub-agents*.

**The context bar carries the one act there is about the figure on it** (`ICompactingSession`,
`CompactContext`, `SessionOptionsReported.CanCompact`). Compact asks the agent to summarise what has been
said and carry on from the summary; nothing this application holds is touched, but it **asks first and
the question opens on Yes** — what that guards is not loss but cost and surprise, a model call on
somebody's budget that changes what the agent remembers, from a control a few pixels from the composer.
It is the one confirmation here whose default button is the affirmative one
(`MessageDialog.ConfirmAsync(defaultsToYes: true)`, opt-in per call) and the one whose unwired answer is
yes — a delegate of its own (`ConfirmExpectingYes`) rather than a flag, so that the rule the rest of the
application keeps, *an unanswered question about throwing something away is no*, cannot be reached for by
a later caller who only wanted the convenient default. Three of the six have a route and each is its own, measured 2026-09-20: Claude Code takes
`/compact` as an ordinary message on its stream-json stdin, codex answers `thread/compact/start` with
`{threadId}` and runs a turn of its own with a `contextCompaction` item in it, and opencode takes
`POST session/{id}/summarize` with `{providerID, modelID}` — both required, and the model is the
session's own, since one the server does not know is a 500. pi, agy and Grok answer nothing and the
button is not drawn for them: ACP has no compaction at all, and a guessed route is a control that
reports having done something to somebody's context window when it has not. **Deliberately not a
`SendMessage` carrying a slash command** — only one of the three reads it as a message, and the host's
send writes a `UserMessageAdded`, so `/compact` would stand in the transcript as something the user said
on a tile where two of the three would never have produced it. **Whether it is offered is the host's
answer and not the session's**, stamped in `Stamp` beside `SessionConfigured.Account`: it is whether the
object the host holds implements the interface, and a session saying it separately is a second copy of
one fact that can disagree with the method actually called. On screen it is at the right-hand end of the
context bar — or, with the bar off, beside the composer's paperclip with the reading in one word (`42%`) — rather than among the composer's pickers — those say what the *next message* runs as, and
this is an act — quieter than anything in the composer, because that one accent belongs to Send; it
takes `WarnText` past 80% of the window, which is `ModelContextWindow`'s own margin rather than a second
opinion, and never without the sentence in its tooltip.

**A change to the workspace's skills reaches the agents already running** (`WorkspaceAgentFiles.SkillsChanged`,
`SkillChangePolicy`). Ticking a database used to write `SKILL.md` and stop, and a CLI already started reads
skills only at start-up — and no agent is treated otherwise (`IAiAgent.WatchesSkillsDirectory(AgentSurface)`
answers no everywhere): Claude Code documents a watcher in its terminal interface, and was observed on
2026-09-18 not to pick up a second database, so every agent tile is told to restart and no skills directory
is made ahead of a skill. An idle Agent tile restarts on its own; one that is busy or holds an unsent message gets a
notice, and a terminal agent tile always does — its restart would take the scrollback and the half-typed
prompt. **A run of changes is one restart, not one each**: every database ticked and every RW toggle
writes the skill again, so the tile waits out `SkillChangePolicy.QuietWindow` (two seconds), coalesces a
change arriving during a restart into one further lap, and asks the policy **again** at the moment it
would start — the window is long enough for a turn to have been sent meanwhile, and that change gets the
notice instead. Acted on per click, three databases were three teardowns and three cold resumes, of which
only the last described what the user meant to grant. The notice comes down at the next start of a process in that tile — a launch, and equally one the
launch chain made on its own after the tool exited (`TerminalTileViewModel.NoteProcessStarting`, said by
`TileLauncher` once the launch is past its refusals and by `DirectLaunchSession` before each command it
starts) — so a bar does not go on asking for a restart that has happened, and equally does not stop
asking for one that a refused launch never made. **In both kinds the notice is the
tile's own bar and never an event of the conversation**: a `NoticeRaised` is stored, so the Agent tile wrote
one identical line per ticked database into `conversations.db`, kept none of it down when the restart it asked
for happened, and said it all again every time the conversation was opened. One line however often the cause
repeats, taken down at the start that satisfies it, and dismissible — `LaunchNotices` for both.

The tile counts as an agent in its workspace and as a process of this machine's: it answers
`IAgentTile` — which `TerminalAgentTileViewModel` answers too, so the workspace's skills and its CLAUDE.md/
AGENTS.md question are asked of both kinds rather than of one view model type — and `IProcessTile`,
through the session's own `IProcessBackedSession`, so the workspace row's memory reading covers the CLI
this tile started.

Claude Code, codex, opencode, pi and agy were each run live through launcher, session, host and checkpoint
(`LiveAgentConversationTests`, opt-in by `MTILES_LIVE_AGENTS`). Grok's resume and ACP surface were measured
live separately (1.0.34, 2026-09-17), installed at `~/.grok/bin` — which `ExecutableFinder` reaches through
its `~/.{name}/bin` rule. Transports, measurements and every trap found on the way are in
[`docs/AGENT-CONVERSATIONS.md`](docs/AGENT-CONVERSATIONS.md) — read it before touching
`src/mTiles.AgentSessions/`, `Services/Agents/Sessions/` or `ViewModels/AgentConversation/`.

## Goal tile

Iterative AI-driven development workflow tile (inspired by Karpathy's autoresearch). Automates the loop:
**user goal → AI clarifying questions → user answers → AI creates plan → user approves/rejects → AI
implements code changes → AI reviews at four severities → iterate until the completion criteria set on
the tile are met → summary**. A goal can also be worked out from the uncommitted changes rather than
typed.

**The working tree is not the tool's to undo.** The review is handed the whole of `git diff HEAD` as
"the changes that were just made", which is untrue whenever the user is working in the terminal tile next
door — so the reviewer reported their parallel change as a finding, the loop passed it back as something
to fix, and the next attempt reverted their files and deleted the ones they had not committed. Two
sentences in the prompts close it (`GoalPromptBuilder.OtherPeoplesWork` and its counterpart in the review
prompt) and `GoalBaseline` photographs the tree as the goal starts, so that when a prompt is ignored — as
the same failure against other agents shows it can be — the loss is one `git checkout` rather than an
afternoon. Neither a stash nor a commit: a private `GIT_INDEX_FILE`, `commit-tree` beside the history and
a ref under `refs/mtiles/`, so nothing the user can see moves. **Untracked files are the point** — no
form of `diff` shows one and `checkout HEAD` cannot bring one back. Read *docs/GOAL.md* before touching
it; four details there were measured and each is load-bearing.

**The tile is a conversation, and the composer is the one thing docked to the bottom of it.** One
`ScrollViewer` (`ChatScroll`), one column: the transcript, and then whatever the tile is asking for — the
round of questions, the plan box, the finished-run actions — each as a block where the next thing in a
conversation goes. The composer, with the detect buttons and its pickers under it, sits **outside** that
scroller, docked to the foot of the tile: it is not something the conversation said but the one place you
act from, and scrolling back two attempts to re-read a review must not take it off the bottom of the tile
(`GoalAskPanelTests.What_the_tile_asks_scrolls_and_what_you_type_in_does_not` pins both halves). **Both
transcripts — this one and the Agent tile's — draw only the tail of the conversation** (`TranscriptWindow`,
`TranscriptPaging`): the last 40 entries, a page of 30 more whenever the reader comes within a screen of the
top, and the top given back while they follow the end; `TranscriptAnchor` is what keeps the reader in place
as a page appears above them. The list's `ItemsSource` is set there and bound nowhere. A round is *replaced by the record of itself* when it is answered, in place,
rather than being asked in a docked panel and recorded as a numbered paragraph several screens above
it. Anything in the conversation can be copied on its own — a message, one finding, one question with
its answer — through one handler and one builder, so a finding copied alone reads exactly as it does
inside the review it came from.

**A review is not automatically an instruction.** The loop stops between a review and the next attempt
(`GoalReviewGatePolicy`, per goal, on the criteria panel): **countdown** — the default, 15 s — shows the
findings with a tick beside each and carries on by itself, **pause** waits for Resume after every review,
**off** is what the loop did before. **Touching a tick stops the clock and it does not start again**,
because somebody who has just decided one finding is not worth fixing is still reading the rest of the
list. What stays ticked is what goes back to the tool; what does not is subtracted once
(`GoalDismissals.Accepted`) from everything that judges the review — the completion criteria, the
sentence saying why they were not met, the feedback and the no-progress fingerprint — since a dismissed
error kept out of the prompt *and* counted by the criteria is a run that can never finish. A blocker
offers no tick, the one severity with no tolerance anywhere. And what carries a dismissal to the next
lap is the review prompt, which names them as decisions already taken: the reviewer is written from
scratch each time and phrases the same defect differently, so the text match — `GoalFinding.Defect`,
shared with the review's own fingerprint and leaving the line out, because an implementation moves the
lines under every defect it did not fix — is a literal-repeat guard under that and never the mechanism.
The reviewer's own `goalMet` is left exactly as it was: it answers a different question, it has no tick,
and a run whose every stated defect is dismissed while the verdict still says no stops as going round in
a circle. See [`docs/GOAL.md`](docs/GOAL.md).

**A run is four jobs, not one** (`GoalRole`, `GoalRoles`, and ADR
[0003](docs/adr/0003-effort-by-role-in-a-goal-run.md)). Planning, work, review and commit each get
their own amount of thinking and — for two of them — their own agent. **The strip still carries one
effort picker**: its word is a *preset* (`balanced` = plan medium · work low · review medium,
`careful` = the same with the review at high — the word `balanced` used to be, and a stored `Balanced`
is migrated onto it — `thorough`, `cheap`, `default`) and the three levels are in the picker row's own description, which is
what lets a setting with three dimensions cost one control in a tile that is often 300px wide. **Commit
is `low` as a constant**, in no preset and on no screen, because naming which changed files belong
together is mechanical — the only exception is the `default` preset, whose whole meaning is to pass no
flag anywhere. The role is derived from the phase (`GoalRoles.For`) and persisted nowhere, so
`GoalPhase` — which is in every goal file, decides `AiUsage` and gates `GoalTilePolicy.CanResume` —
does not grow a member for the commit plan; that one call names its role at the call site, or it would
be attributed to the reviewer and run at the reviewer's effort. **Three agent slots**: the execution
agent in the strip (it writes, so it is the one value that has to be readable at a glance), and
`planned by` and `reviewed by` in the criteria panel, both defaulting to "same as execution". Only the
execution agent ever writes, which is what keeps a second agent compatible with the worktree
`GoalBaseline` photographs once.

**Everything else is in [`docs/GOAL.md`](docs/GOAL.md)** — the phase machine, the prompts and how they
are fitted to a command line, the structured review and its severities, the completion criteria, the
per-goal SOLID switches and the two health checks, what a run remembers between attempts, Continue,
the `@` file mentions, the persistence rules, and the reasoning behind each. The section grew to a third of this file, which is the same argument that moved
dictation out: read it before touching `Services/Goal*`, `Services/WorktreeReader.cs`,
`Services/CommandDisplay.cs`, `Services/*FileMention*` / `Views/FileMentionBehavior.cs` or
`ViewModels/Goal*` — the last of
which is a wider glob than it looks: `GoalCriteriaEditor`, `GoalBadge`, `GoalSolidToggle` and
`GoalQuestionAnswer` are view models of their own, not part of the tile's.

## Token proxy

Optional, per agent instance: the shell commands an agent runs are rewritten to go through
[rtk](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk), which filters their output — 60–90% fewer tokens on `git status`,
a test run, a build. A tick in Settings → AI on the instance's own form, beside `ExtraArgs`, which is
the other field there that changes what the CLI is actually told. Off by default, the rule
`DefaultBehaviour` keeps: a row nobody has been asked about must not quietly do something to what the
agent runs. Everything is in ADR [0005](docs/adr/0005-an-output-proxy-per-agent-instance.md); what is
worth knowing here:

**It goes through the file this application already generates, never `~/.claude/settings.json`.**
rtk's own way in is `rtk init --global`, which patches the user's file; `ClaudeSessionSettings` has
carried a `--settings` file since the `Concise` output style, so the hook block goes in there and the
tick changes this application's sessions and no others. **Two files, not one rewritten per launch**
(`session-settings.json`, `session-settings-rtk.json`): the path is what reaches the command line, and
two tiles on two instances are launched milliseconds apart out of one process — one file rewritten per
launch is those two racing over a path they have both already been handed, so whichever launched second
decides what the first one runs.

**The agent says whether it has a route** (`IAiAgent.OutputProxySupport`, virtual on `AiAgent` and
never a default interface member, for the reason `UsesModelContextWindow` spells out), and
`SessionDefaultArgs` grew an `AiAgentInstance` parameter so the answer can depend on the row. Measured
2026-09-22 against rtk 0.46.0, each probed with `rtk init` against a sandboxed config directory:
**Claude Code** takes a `PreToolUse` hook in a settings file and is wired; **pi** takes
`<PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR>/extensions/rtk.ts` loaded with `pi -e <path>` — the same shape, and the next one
to wire, answering `None` with the measurement in its own class until the file is generated into a
directory this application owns; **opencode** takes a plugin in `~/.config/opencode/plugins/` and has no
per-run flag at all, so it answers `WritesOutsideOurDirectories` — a route named and refused rather than
one nobody found, because taking it would turn a tick on one instance into a change to every opencode
session on the machine, the ones started from a shell included, with nothing here able to take it back off.

**Three facts decide it and the tick is only one.** rtk has to be on this machine at all
(`OutputProxy.Locate`), and Claude Code's own settings
must **not** already carry an rtk hook — the CLI runs every matching entry, so ours beside theirs is one
command handed to the proxy twice, which is a behaviour nobody chose arrived at by two pieces of
configuration that cannot see each other. Asked at the moment the file is written rather than
remembered, so rtk installed from the Settings row applies at the next launch with nothing to click
again; the form says which of the two is true rather than leaving the tick looking ignored, and stays
enabled under both, because what is stored is what the user wants and a machine fact changing underneath
a row is not a reason they cannot set it up in advance. `OutputProxyGlobalHook` reads that file and
**never writes it** — the whole premise is that nothing here edits it — and asks by **substring**: a JSON
walk for the exact shape answers *no* for a hook written by hand, spelled with an absolute path or
wrapped in a shell, all of which are live, and being wrong towards "already there" costs one tick while
being wrong the other way is the double rewrite.

**Goal runs are deliberately not covered.** `AiProcessRunner` never passed `--settings` at all, so
adding it now would also hand every goal run the `Concise` output style its parser has never seen —
a separate change with its own risk.

**Installing it is Windows-only, and only where winget can be found** (`rtk-ai.rtk`). Measured
2026-09-23: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsApps` is in *no* process' `PATH` on a good many Windows 11
machines — not the GUI's, not PowerShell's, not Git Bash's — so the alias sits there pointing at a
working binary while every shell answers `command not found`. `ExecutableFinder` now walks that
directory too, and `OutputProxy.Plan` is asked **per call** and answers `null` where winget is still
not found, so the row shows the link rather than a button certain to fail. On Linux the published route
is a piped shell installer and this application does not put `curl … | sh` behind a button, because the
confirmation could not say what is being approved; that row gets the link. **`cargo install rtk` is
never offered anywhere**: crates.io carries a different program under that exact name — Rust *Type*
Kit — which answers `rtk --version` and fails every hook, and a test asserts the plan does not reach
for it. The notice above the lists appears **only where an instance asked for the proxy and rtk is
missing**, which is the difference from the clipboard notice beside it: that one is about a capability
every agent on the platform lacks, this one about a decision already made that has quietly been doing
nothing.

**What the hook produces is a bare name, so the launch puts rtk on the session's `PATH`.**
Measured 2026-09-23 against rtk 0.46.0 by feeding it a `PreToolUse` payload: it answers
`{"updatedInput":{"command":"rtk git status"}}`. So however carefully the hook's *own* command is
spelled — and it is spelled with the full path, which is what makes it survive a `PATH` ours does not
carry — what finally runs is `rtk …` in the tile's shell. On a machine where rtk sits somewhere no
shell searches, that would be `rtk: command not found` on **every** Bash call the agent makes: the
command *fails* rather than merely missing its saving, which is worse than having no proxy at all.
**And that case is ordinary rather than exotic**: winget installs into
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WinGet\Links` and adds it to the *user's* `PATH`, a change no
already-running process sees — so mTiles that installed rtk from its own Settings row is, by
construction, a process whose `PATH` does not carry what it just installed. The first answer was a
sentence on the row telling the user to fix their `PATH` and restart; it is now closed instead
(`OutputProxy.DirectoryToPrependToPath`, applied in `ClaudeAgent.Configure`): rtk's own directory goes
in front of the `PATH` of any session carrying the hook, additively, so a shell rc file that appends
to what it was given keeps its own entries. `OutputProxyFor` and that `PATH` line belong together and
will be wrong together if either moves alone.

**And `rtk gain` cannot see any of this, which misleads in the one direction that costs something.**
It reports on the hook in the CLI's *own* settings — the one `rtk init -g` writes — so on a machine
hooked from here it prints *No hook installed — run `rtk init -g`* whatever our hook is doing.
Measured 2026-09-23 on a machine where the proxy was verifiably rewriting: the counter rose by exactly
one per rewritten shell call while that warning stayed on screen. Following its advice adds a second
hook beside ours and hands one command to the proxy twice, so the active state on the Settings row
says the warning is expected and names the command not to run. **The counter is also a weak
instrument in the other direction**: rtk records what it *rewrote*, and a command it has no rule for
passes through uncounted — so a flat counter is not evidence that the hook failed to fire.

## Agent-facing files

Measured 2026-09-03 against the installed binaries: opencode, codex, pi and agy all read `AGENTS.md`
without being asked; **Claude Code alone does not** — it loads `CLAUDE.md` by a hard-coded path and has
no discovery for `AGENTS.md` at all. This used to be closed with a one-line `@AGENTS.md` shim in
`CLAUDE.md`; it is now closed by **opt-in, per-workspace, two-way content sync** between the two files
(`Services/AgentFileSyncEngine.cs` + `Services/AgentFileSyncCoordinator.cs`, see *CLAUDE.md ↔ AGENTS.md
sync* below) — the shim's own rejection of symlinks (Windows without `core.symlinks` materialises a
text file with a path in it, read as the whole of the instructions) and of generating full copies still
stands; what changed is that "two-way sync by mtime" moved from rejected to the actual mechanism, now
that it is a decision the user makes per workspace rather than something imposed silently on every one.
A `CLAUDE.md` an earlier build left holding that one-line import is taken out by
`LegacyInstructionShimCleanup` — same category and same expiry date as `LegacyDatabaseSectionCleanup` —
but **only where the sync is actually switched on**, and it is written straight back as a copy of
`AGENTS.md`. Removing it on every workspace open instead takes the only file Claude Code reads away
from a user who declined the wizard, or who wrote that one-line import themselves. What the shim must
not do meanwhile is reach the wizard as one of two versions to choose between — answering "CLAUDE.md is
the current one" would replace the whole of `AGENTS.md` with that single line — so
`LegacyInstructionShimCleanup.IsPresentIn` is asked first and the question narrows to the plain
yes/no. **The shim is recognised even where the `AGENTS.md` it names is gone**: it imports a file that
is not there and holds none of the user's words either way, and left unrecognised it is seeded into a
new `AGENTS.md` whose whole content is the circular `@AGENTS.md` — which codex, pi and agy read as the
project's instructions. Enabling the sync therefore takes it out and seeds nothing; a decline keeps it.

**The database section stopped being a section and became a skill** (`mtiles-database`). Three faults
went with it: machine detail in a committed file, `claude.local.md` being the wrong name on Linux, and
cutting a heading-bounded region back out of somebody else's document. A fourth thing was won — the old
section was deliberately thin because it sat in the context of every turn, while a skill's body loads
on demand and has room for the whole contract. Which makes its **description the only trigger**, so it
names the databases themselves and says what to use it *instead of* (reading the code). **No pointer is
written into any instruction file**: most repositories have a `CLAUDE.md` and no `AGENTS.md`, so a
pointer would *create* `AGENTS.md` holding one sentence about databases — and pi, codex and agy read
`AGENTS.md` and never open `CLAUDE.md`, so switching database access on would cut three agents off from
the project's documentation, silently.

**Two answers on the agent class**, the same shape as `SignInEnv` and `SessionIdForTile`:
`IAiAgent.SkillsDirectory(workspaceDir)` (claude `.claude/skills`, opencode `.opencode/skills`, and
codex, pi and agy all three `.agents/skills`) and `IAiAgent.InstructionFile` (the canon, overridden only
by `ClaudeAgent`). Both default to the harmless answer — null and the canon — so an agent whose author
forgets them gets *less*, never a file written somewhere nobody measured. The agent says **where**; the
database tile says **what**; `Services/Agents/` never learns that databases exist.

**`Services/WorkspaceAgentFiles.cs` is what joins them, one per workspace** — the same category as
`WorkspaceGitWatcher`, reached through `TileContext.AgentFiles`. **The source of truth is the tile
tree, not the machine**: a project you only ever open Claude Code in gets `.claude/skills` and
`CLAUDE.md` and nothing else, because creating `.opencode/skills` in somebody's repository for a tool
nobody here uses is littering. And it cannot live in the database tile, because **three agents share
`.agents/skills`**: closing the pi tile must not take the directory a codex tile is still reading. The
rule is therefore "recompute the set of paths and delete the difference" rather than "delete that
agent's directory", and that needs one object that knows the whole workspace. `WorkspaceViewModel`
asks it on every layout change, and it is cheap when the answer has not moved — which it nearly always
has not, since a dragged splitter reaches it too.

**Writing and deleting are asymmetric, and that is not an oversight.** A write goes only to the paths
of the agents present here. A **blind** delete — `RemoveSkillEverywhere`, triggered by the last
database being unticked and by the service being switched off — goes to every path any agent could ever
read, without looking at the tiles at all. It is a security rule and not tidiness: no agent may find
out about a bridge that is no longer there, and deleting something that was not there costs nothing
against leaving a live database address in a directory nobody remembers. **A skill that cannot be
built yet is neither of those** (`DatabaseServiceManager.UpdateDatabaseSkill`): at startup a restored
database tile publishes from its own constructor while discovery is still running on the thread pool,
so every discovered database is momentarily unknown to `DbRegistry` — read as a withdrawal, that took
the marked block out of a tracked `.gitignore` on every launch and left the skill missing for the rest
of the session. The `SKILL.md` still goes, because it would name an address the bridge is not
publishing; the line stays, and the tile republishes when the registry's `StateChanged` says it knows.
**`CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` content is no longer `WorkspaceAgentFiles`' concern at all** — it never
writes, reconciles or deletes either file; that whole question moved to `AgentFileSyncEngine`/
`AgentFileSyncCoordinator`, opt-in per workspace (see *CLAUDE.md ↔ AGENTS.md sync* below). Only our own
`<skills>/mtiles-database/` subdirectory is deleted, never the skills directory itself, which is the
same rule `GitIgnoreFile` follows for `.mtiles/`.

**The skill's own directory is listed in the workspace's `.gitignore`** — `.claude/skills/mtiles-database/`
and never `.claude/skills`, through the same marked block `GitIgnoreFile` writes for `.mtiles/`, and only
where the workspace is a repository. A `SKILL.md` carries `http://localhost:<port>` and the names of this
machine's servers, which untracked and unignored waits in every `git status` for a `git add .` — the
"machine detail in a committed file" that the section became a skill to be rid of. The edits are queued on
one chain off the caller's thread (`GitIgnoreEditQueue` — `GitIgnoreFile` is asynchronous and this is
reached from the UI thread on every layout change; ordering, atomicity and what happens at shutdown are
one reason to change and belong to nobody's workspace, so they are a class of their own), and ordered
rather than fired and forgotten, so a skill written and withdrawn a moment later does not leave its line
behind. **The line goes when the user withdraws access, never when
a tile closes** (`WorkspaceAgentFiles.ForgetSkill`, asked for by `DatabaseServiceManager.ForgetDatabaseSkill`):
closing the window disposes every tile, so the two being one call took the marked block out of a tracked
`.gitignore` on every exit and put it back on every launch — a modification in `git diff` twice a session,
for a decision nobody made. The `SKILL.md` still goes, because that half is the security rule. And
`DisposeAll` **waits** on the chain (`GitIgnoreEditQueue.WaitForAll`, bounded at two seconds): it is the one piece of
work here nobody else joins, and an edit abandoned mid-write leaves a `.gitignore.mtiles-tmp` in somebody's
repository.

Everything else, including the measurements and the alternatives that were rejected, is in
[`docs/AGENTS-MD-SYNC.md`](docs/AGENTS-MD-SYNC.md).

## CLAUDE.md ↔ AGENTS.md sync

Opt-in, per workspace: while on, `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` carry identical content, live — edit
either one and the other is overwritten to match within a debounce window. Off by default per
workspace until the user says otherwise; a global switch in Settings → General
(`AppSettings.AgentFileSyncEnabled`, default on) overrides every workspace's answer at once.

`Services/AgentFileSyncPolicy.cs` is the pure decision of whether a workspace needs to be asked at
all — a table test, the same convention as `ChainPolicy`/`UsagePace`: both files present is worth
asking about regardless of whether their content agrees (asking which is authoritative only when it
doesn't); exactly one file present is worth asking about only when a tile in the workspace reads the
*other* one (`IAiAgent.InstructionFile`); neither file present asks nothing. Once answered — enable or
decline — a workspace is never asked again automatically; only the workspace's context-menu toggle or
the global switch changes it after that.

`Services/AgentFileSyncEngine.cs` is one per loaded workspace: a `FileSystemWatcher` filtered to
exactly `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` at the workspace root, plus a cache of each path's last-seen mtime
and content. **Loop prevention is that cache, not a lock on the writer**: every write this engine makes
immediately re-stamps the cache with the content the write produced, so the watcher event that write
itself causes reads back bytes it already has and does nothing. **What says a side moved is its
content, never its last-write time** — that used to be an mtime comparison, and a clock is too coarse
to carry it: measured, two consecutive writes to one file land on the identical mtime about half the
time, so a checkout or a formatter rewriting one of the two within a tick of the previous write was
read as this engine's own output and thrown away, leaving the pair apart until somebody saved again.
The comparison is free — the file is already in memory by then — and the mtime stays for the one
question that is about the clock, which of two sides that both changed is newer.
Deletion is read as damage to repair from the
other file, never as opting out (opting out is the toggle, never `rm`); if both files change in the
same debounce window, the one with the later actual mtime wins. **Starting is a reconcile, not only a
seeding**: nothing watches while the application is closed, so a pull, a checkout or an edit in another
tool can leave the two apart — cached as it stands, that disagreement becomes the engine's own idea of
*unchanged*, and the first later edit of one side silently overwrites the other side's offline changes.
A pair that already agrees is cached and nothing is written; a pair that does not is left out of the
cache and reconciled by the same "always from the newest" rule every later edit takes, after the watcher
is live so the engine's own write reads back as its own. **A file that cannot be read is a third
answer and re-arms the reconcile** rather than waiting for the next event: the event that led here has
already been consumed, so a file held open for a moment by an editor, an antivirus or a cloud-sync
client would otherwise leave the two sides quietly disagreeing until somebody happened to save one of
them. Bounded at five attempts, because a file unreadable for good must not arm a timer for the life of
the session. **A failing watcher is rebuilt, not resigned** — the name filters are applied in managed
code, so the native buffer collects everything the directory produces and a large checkout at the
workspace root fills it; that is lost events, and stopping for good would leave the two files free to
drift for the rest of the session while the config still reads enabled. The git tile answers the same
event by refreshing rather than giving up; the equivalent here is a rebuild — a fresh watcher, and a
seeding that is the same reconcile an offline window gets — bounded the way `RelaunchBudget` is
bounded, at most three per ten minutes, because a filesystem whose watchers die as fast as they are
raised must not spin. The buffer is also sized to what the workspace's own git watcher carries
(51200). **What it moves is bytes, not text** —
the rule `GitIgnoreFile` already follows: this never modifies the content, only copies it, so decoding
through the default UTF-8 would only cost the source's BOM and mangle a file written in any other
encoding. **The seeding write is the one that keeps a copy**: it is the only mirror that can replace
content this application has never carried — an `AGENTS.md` nobody has committed — so the losing file
is copied to `<name>.pre-sync-<timestamp>` first, the rule the layout migrations already follow
(`{id}.pre-kind.json`), the wizard says so before the buttons, and a copy that cannot be written
**stops** the overwrite rather than proceeding without the safeguard. Every mirror after it is the sync
the user switched on and leaves nothing behind. **A run has a number** (`_epoch`, bumped by every
`StartAsync`): an answer arriving for a mirror that is already live is a `Stop` immediately followed by
a `StartAsync(authoritative)`, which puts `IsRunning` back to true before a reconcile already in flight
looks at it — and that reconcile would then settle the pair by mtime, overwriting the very file the
user has just named as the current one. Checking the epoch only before the I/O would not hold it:
`Stop` does not wait on the reconcile gate, so the question is asked again after the reads and again
after the seeding write's backup — every await the answer can land in — and a superseded reconcile
that has already read both files does nothing at all, rather than going on to make the pair agree
behind the answer and leaving the seeding nothing to settle.

`Services/AgentFileSyncCoordinator.cs` is one per application, alongside `DatabaseServiceManager`: it
holds the live engine for every workspace currently loaded, owns the one `ShowWizard` dialog Func
(`Views/AgentFileSyncWizard`), and reacts to the global switch changing by starting or stopping every
loaded engine. **One wizard is open at a time for the whole application** — the per-workspace gate says
nothing about two of them, and two asking at once is the ordinary case, since every question held before
the window existed is replayed together the moment `ShowWizard` is wired. The context-menu toggle takes
the legacy shim out first (`LegacyInstructionShimCleanup`) as well as the workspace opening does — but
**only where an engine will actually run**, because the toggle can be reached with the global switch
off (the menu item's visibility is decided when the menu is built): everything in that path exists to
bring a mirror up, so with the switch off the answer is recorded and the shim is left exactly where it
was — taking it out ahead of a start that never comes leaves the workspace with no file Claude Code
reads at all. The engine's own start is the safety net for the answer that waited: it takes a shim
still on disk out and names `AGENTS.md` the current one, because a file holding none of the user's
words is not one of two versions to settle by mtime. The toggle also reaches a row nobody has ever
opened, where the shim is still on disk and reads to the wizard as a CLAUDE.md whose content differs. The wizard, when shown, asks to enable and — only when the two files already disagree —
which one is current, showing size and last-modified for each; that answer is then handed to
`AgentFileSyncEngine.StartAsync(authoritativeFileName)` rather than acted on by the coordinator —
making the two files agree is one rule, and the engine already owns the reading, the byte comparison
and the atomic write, so seeding is its own first reconcile with the winner named instead of taken
from the mtimes. **Its own write is re-stamped into the cache only when what comes back off disk is
what was written**: an edit landing in that window would otherwise be remembered as the engine's own
write, read as unchanged for ever after and never carried across, leaving the two permanently apart. The per-workspace answer lives at `.mtiles/agent-file-sync.json`
(`Models/WorkspaceAgentFileSyncConfig`) — its absence means "never asked", never "declined" — and it is
read and written by `Services/AgentFileSyncConfigStore.cs`, which is a class of its own because where
the answer lives changes for its own reasons and not when the rules for asking do. Serialising the
decisions is likewise `Services/WorkspaceWorkGate.cs`: one at a time per workspace, each handed the
*load generation* it began under, since every entry point here is fire-and-forget and a decision that
spans a dialog must not act on a workspace that has been unloaded meanwhile.

**The global switch suppresses the question, it does not answer it**, so nothing is written down while
it is off — and turning it back on therefore re-runs the whole evaluation for every loaded workspace
rather than only starting and stopping engines — but **only when the switch itself has moved**:
`SettingsChanged` is raised for every property on that dialog, per keystroke in a text field, and this
feature reads one of them, so the remembered value is what keeps a typed character from costing a config
read and both instruction files per loaded workspace. Nothing else would bring the question back until
the tile tree changed or the workspace was re-opened. What that costs is remembering each loaded
workspace's agents (`_agentsSeen`): the tile tree belongs to the UI thread and Settings hands the
coordinator nothing.

## Database tile

Per-workspace bridge that lets LLM agents (Claude Code, OpenCode, etc.) query local databases directly via HTTP — without manual connection setup. The tile publishes a **skill** (`mtiles-database`) into the skill directories of the agents this workspace actually holds, so agents discover the available databases and the whole contract for calling them. It touches no instruction file — see *Agent-facing files* below and [`docs/AGENTS-MD-SYNC.md`](docs/AGENTS-MD-SYNC.md).

**Purpose:** LLM agent running in a terminal tile sends `GET /query/{server}/{database}?sql=SELECT ...` to the local HTTP server → gets JSON results back. No credentials exposed to the agent; access is controlled by the user in the tile UI.

**Write protection (SQL Guard):** INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE blocked by default. User unlocks per-database with the RW toggle. DROP/TRUNCATE/ALTER always blocked regardless. If the agent sends a write query and write is disabled, a confirmation dialog appears — the user approves or denies in real time. Block comments (`/* */`) and line comments (`--`) are stripped before keyword scanning to prevent bypass attempts.

**Tile UI:** List of selected databases with RW/RO toggle, list of all discovered databases with add button. Publishing the skill is automatic — driven by the global database service setting (Settings) and whether any databases are selected in the tile. Tile reacts to `DatabaseServiceManager.StateChanged` and `SettingsChanged`.

**Architecture:** `DatabaseServiceManager` (singleton in App) manages `DbRegistry`, `DbLogger`, `DiscoveryService` and `DbHttpServer`. Tile registers its workspace with the manager (`RegisterWorkspace`/`UnregisterWorkspace`).

**Access control:** HTTP server exposes only databases selected in at least one workspace tile. `IsDatabaseAllowed(key)` checks the union of grants across all workspaces. `GET /databases` returns only allowed databases. Host header validated to `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`/`::1` — blocks DNS rebinding attacks from browser tabs.

**Database discovery:** SQL Server via UDP broadcast on port 1434 (SQL Browser). PostgreSQL via port scanning (default 5432, 5433, 5434) on localhost and the local network. Manual connections also supported. Discovery runs periodically (default every 30 min).

**HTTP Server:** `DbHttpServer` on a configurable port (default 18090). Endpoints:
- `GET /databases` — list of allowed databases (filtered by grants)
- `GET/POST /query/{server}/{database}?sql=...` — SQL queries (allowed databases only)
- `GET/POST /query/{server}/{instance}/{database}` — with instance
- POST body limit: 512KB. Result limit: 50k rows / 16MB.

**Skill generation:** `DatabaseSkillWriter` builds the `SKILL.md` — front matter naming the databases themselves, because the description is the only trigger the model ever sees, then the endpoints, what `SqlGuard` blocks outright, what a write against a read-only database costs (a dialog in front of the user, and the query waits), and the 50k-row / 16MB / 512KB limits. It writes to no file: `WorkspaceAgentFiles` decides where it goes. The old `ClaudeLocalMdWriter`, which injected a `# Database access` section into `claude.local.md` and `AGENTS.md`, is gone — a section in a committed file carried machine-specific detail, `claude.local.md` was the wrong name on Linux (Claude Code opens `CLAUDE.local.md` literally), and cutting a heading-bounded region back out of somebody else's document is a class of bug rather than a feature. Both leftovers are cleared up once, per workspace, by `LegacyDatabaseSectionCleanup` — a class of its own, called explicitly by `WorkspaceViewModel` rather than run as a side effect of `WorkspaceAgentFiles` being constructed, because a migration has its own reason to change and its own expiry date, and because editing files in somebody's repository is not something a constructor should do to whoever merely reached it. **The section goes, the file stays — even when nothing is left in it**: on Windows `claude.local.md` is `CLAUDE.local.md`, somebody's own local instructions the old writer only appended to, and the writer *created* `AGENTS.md` where there was none, so a user who has since committed either would otherwise see this application delete a tracked file out of their working tree — the rule `GitIgnoreFile` already follows for a `.gitignore` it emptied. All three headings the old writer ever used are looked for, and a section is taken only when it carries the bridge's own evidence.

**Workspace config:** `.mtiles/databases.json` — `WorkspaceDatabaseTileConfig` with `Databases` (list). Context files are generated when database service is running and the list is non-empty.

**Settings:** Database tab in Settings — enable service, HTTP port, SQL Server (Windows Auth / SQL Auth), PostgreSQL (credentials, ports), scan interval, manual connections (add, edit, clone, test, delete — the form is the shared overlay every settings entry is edited on; **Export/Import** on the heading row, `ManualConnectionsPortability`). Save & Apply restarts the service automatically. Passwords encrypted with DPAPI.

**A connections file is a merge, and a file of its own.** `ManualConnectionsPortability` writes the
list — the passwords included, under a `PassphraseVault` passphrase (the same vault the settings
export uses), or without them — to its own format, and its import **overwrites what matches** (by id,
then address, then alias — the two ways `DbRegistry` files a row), **adds what is missing and removes
nothing** (`ManualConnectionMerge`, pure and argued in a table test): handing a file to a colleague
must not be handing them the whole configuration. A password that did not travel arrives empty and is
read as *not said*, so it never erases the one stored here; and a candidate value that would land on
another row keeps the stored one — alias and address, the port with the address — so the merged list
never holds a clash the form would refuse. The two files refuse each other by name
(`ManualConnectionsBundle.Kind`; the settings import recognises a connections file and names the
Database tab, and this import refuses a settings export by the same question), because a settings
export dropped into this importer would otherwise read as a file with no connections in it.

**A name and an address may each be used once** (`ManualConnectionClash`, pure and argued in a table
test). `DbRegistry.Register` files an instance under its address — server, instance, database — **and**
under its lowercased alias, so two connections agreeing on either do not coexist: the second overwrites
the first, an agent asking for that name reaches a database nobody pointed it at with credentials
nobody chose, and deleting one of them takes the other's alias route with it. Both rows meanwhile look
fine on the page. So it is a query answered by the wrong server rather than an untidy list, and Save
refuses it with a sentence above the buttons rather than a disabled button that explains nothing.
**Cloning is what made the rule worth stating**: copying a row is the one gesture whose starting point
is a duplicate, so a clone arrives with a name that is already free (`X copy`, `X copy 2`) and the
address left exactly as it was — which is the field the user came to change, and until they do, Save
says so. The clone is a *new* object, not the stored one, so Cancel really does leave the original
alone.

**Past three rows the list gets a filter**, the same control and the same threshold as the workspaces
panel and the detected-databases list below it — one page, one way of narrowing a list. Every word,
anywhere, in any order, over the name, the address and the provider. A filter that leaves nothing says
so, because a list that empties itself without a word reads as connections that have gone.

**Logs:** `DbLogger` — HTTP query and discovery logs in memory (max 500) + daily files in `%APPDATA%/mTiles/db-logs/`.

**Services:** `Services/Database/` — IDbProvider, SqlServerProvider, PostgreSqlProvider, SqlGuard, SqlGuardProfile, QueryHandler, DbRegistry, DiscoveryService, DbHttpServer, DbLogger, SubnetScanner, DatabaseServiceManager, DatabaseSkillWriter.

## Usage tile

A read-only dashboard: for every account this machine can **actually ask**, how much of the limit window
is gone, when it comes back, whether the week is being spent faster than the week is passing, and what
what is left on it where the answer is money. It starts nothing, kills nothing and holds no state
a user would miss — which is why `UsageTileKind.Save` answers `null` and the tile implements `IBusyTile`
and none of the other tile interfaces.

**Two questions, each asked of the thing that knows.** `IAiAgent.UsageAsync(AiSignIn?, ct)` and
`IAiProvider.UsageAsync(AiProviderInstance, ct)`, both defaulting to `null`. Measured 2026-09-01, and
only four of the twelve answer at all: **Claude Code** through `GET api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage`
with the OAuth token out of the CLI's own `.credentials.json` (`ClaudeUsageReader`), **codex** out of the
last `token_count` event in the newest `~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl` — there is no endpoint,
`backend-api/codex/usage` answers 403 at the edge (`CodexUsageReader`) — **agy** through
`POST daily-cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com/v1internal:retrieveUserQuotaSummary` (`AntigravityUsageReader`,
below) and **OpenRouter** through `api/v1/key` plus `api/v1/credits`. z.ai, the Anthropic API, ccs, LM
Studio and Ollama publish nothing.

**agy's is the one answer gated on a header, and the header's absence names the wrong cause**
(`AntigravityUsageReader`, measured 2026-09-03 against agy 1.1.22). The service reads the word
`antigravity` in the request's user agent as "this is the client that may ask": with it the answer is
200, and with anything else — a default user agent, or `agy/1.1.22`, which is what the binary is
actually called — it is `403 … You do not have a valid license of this product (#3501)` against a
consumer account that is perfectly well licensed. So the one plausible reading of that error is the
wrong one, which is why the constant carrying the word is documented rather than tidy. The answer is
**two groups of models with two windows each** — Gemini's family and the third-party one (Claude, GPT)
have separate allowances — so an agy card carries four windows where a Claude Code card carries two, and
`UsageWindowsPanel` stacks them. It is proto3 over JSON, where a field at its default is omitted, so a
bucket carrying **no** `remainingFraction` is read as *nothing left* rather than skipped: dropping it
would take the card silent at exactly the moment somebody is looking at it to find out why agy stopped
answering.

**agy keeps its login in the OS keyring, not in a file** (`AntigravityCredentialStore`). Measured
2026-09-03: `~/.gemini/oauth_creds.json` is the *gemini-cli* login and can be months stale — this
machine's had expired in June — while the credential the CLI runs on is a generic Windows Credential
Manager entry named `gemini:antigravity`. Renewal goes to Google's own token endpoint with agy's client
id and the secret out of its binary (public in the same sense gemini-cli's is), and **nothing is written
back**: the exchange returns no new refresh token, so unlike `ClaudeCredentialStore` — which has to
rewrite the CLI's own file or log the user out — this holds the renewal in memory for its hour and
touches nobody's storage.

**That client pair will stop working one day, and this is how it is replaced.** It is Google's, not
ours, so it moves when Google moves it; the symptom is an agy card that says Antigravity would not
answer, with `Refreshing the Antigravity token answered 400` in `%APPDATA%/mTiles/logs`. Both halves
live in the installed binary:

```bash
strings -n 10 ~/AppData/Local/agy/bin/agy.exe | grep -oE "GOCSPX-[A-Za-z0-9_-]{20,}" | sort -u
```

That answers more than one — the current pairing was found by trying each against the token endpoint
with a live refresh token, where the wrong one answers `invalid_client`. The **id** is not in the
binary in a greppable form and is easier read off the login itself: `tokeninfo` names the client the
token was issued to.

```bash
curl -s "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/tokeninfo?access_token=$TOKEN"   # -> "azp": the client id
```

`$TOKEN` is the `access_token` inside the `gemini:antigravity` credential (PowerShell + `CredRead`, or
just read it while agy is running). Both go into `AntigravityCredentialStore` **XOR-ed with `0x5A` and
base64-encoded**, which is what `Unscramble` there undoes:

```bash
python -c "import base64;print(base64.b64encode(bytes(b^0x5A for b in input().encode())).decode())"
```

That protects nothing — it is undone two lines below the constants — and is only there because GitHub's
push protection matches the literal shape of a Google client secret and cannot tell one published in a
download from one that leaked. **Plain base64 does not get past it**: measured, the scanner decodes it
and blocks the push just the same, which is the whole reason for the XOR. Say all of that in the comment
when replacing them, or the next reader will take the encoding for a safeguard.

**Windows only**, and that is a limit rather than a gap: on Linux agy uses the
secret service over D-Bus, which this application has no reader for, so the agent answers `null` and the
tile draws no card, exactly as on a machine with no agy at all. There are no sign-in rows here
(`SupportsSignIns` is false — agy switches Google accounts itself), so one machine is one card, keyed
by the address in `~/.gemini/google_accounts.json`.

**A token this application did not issue is also one nothing else renews** (`ClaudeCredentialStore`).
Claude Code refreshes lazily, when it is *run*, so a login the user works in on Tuesdays carries an
expired `accessToken` for the rest of the week: the usage endpoint answers 401 and a perfectly good
subscription loses its card — measured 2026-09-02 on a machine with three logins, two of them expired
and the one card on screen being whichever account had been used that hour. The exchange is
`POST api.anthropic.com/v1/oauth/token` with Claude Code's own public client id, and two details are
load-bearing: every other plausible spelling of that path answers 404, and a request with **no user
agent** is refused at the edge by Cloudflare with a 403 carrying `error code: 1010` — which is not an
OAuth answer at all and would read here as a dead refresh token. **The refresh token rotates and the old
one dies the moment it is spent**, which decides everything else: the renewal is written back into the
CLI's own file — whole, through a temporary file and a move, owner-only — because keeping it in memory
would leave Claude Code holding a token Anthropic has already invalidated, which is a **logout**. One
refresh at a time per file, since a machine whose default account lives inside a sign-in's directory
asks about that one file twice in the same round and a rotating token cannot be spent twice. A refused
exchange hands back the stale token and changes nothing, so the failure arrives as the sentence the card
already knows how to say.

**Three distinctions the whole tile rests on, and each is a card that would otherwise lie:**

- **`null` is not a failure and a failure is not a zero.** `null` means *there is no such question
  here* — an agent that publishes no limits, a default account nobody has logged into on this machine —
  and the tile draws no card. An `AiUsageReport` carrying a `Problem` is an account that exists and
  could not be asked, and the sentence stands where the figures would have been, the rule
  `AgentAvailability` set. A zero for either reads as an account that has run out.
- **A subscription answers in percent and a provider in money**, and they are not two views of one
  number: there is no rate to convert with, so `AiUsageWindow` carries both and a card draws whichever
  it was given. Every figure on it is nullable and `null` is *did not say*. What a metered account's card
  says under its windows is **what is left and nothing else** — a row of daily bars and a note saying how
  long this application had been watching was a second line answering a question nobody asks of a key.
- **Codex's numbers are as fresh as its last reply**, so `AiUsageReport.MeasuredAt` is the event's own
  timestamp rather than the moment of the read, and a reading older than the window it describes is
  stamped and dimmed (`UsageDisplay.Age`) rather than shown as current.

**An account that could not be asked gets no card** (`UsageTileViewModel.Rebuild` keeps only
`AiUsageReport.Answered`), **and its reason goes to the log instead** (`AiUsageService.Explain`, once per
round). Dropping the card is deliberately the opposite of what `Problem` was built for, and it is a
decision about this screen rather than about the type: most of these failures are an account the user
does not reach through this machine — a CLI's default login on a machine where they only use sign-ins —
and a dashboard whose permanent top line is a sentence about one of them is a dashboard they stop
reading. The logging is the other half of it and is not optional: without it every sentence these
readers take trouble to write was constructed and thrown away, and a genuinely broken account vanished
in silence. The layers underneath log their own failures, but only the ones that are a failed call —
nothing down there knows that eight rollouts in a row carried no reading.

**One login reached two ways is one card.** The same subscription can be logged into twice — the CLI's
own default account and an mTiles sign-in — and then it is two directories holding two unrelated
`.credentials.json` files that answer with one set of figures. `AiUsageReport.AccountKey` is what says
they are the same, and for Claude Code it is the account's own id: `oauthAccount.accountUuid` out of
`.claude.json`, prefixed so it cannot collide, compared in memory and never stored, shown or logged.
Measured on a machine with three logins — the default and one sign-in carry the same uuid, which was
exactly the pair the tile drew twice. Where the id is not there (a directory logged into whose
`.claude.json` the CLI has not written yet) the canonicalised path is the fallback, and it is honest
about being weaker: two rows on one path are certainly one login, which is the case `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`
produces and is what codex's key still is. The read is `AiAgent.ReadJsonString`, which stops at the
answer — that file carries a Claude Code installation's whole per-project history. **A report with no key
is never merged with anything** — two accounts wrongly folded together is a subscription missing from
the screen, which is worse than the repetition. Which name survives is decided by
`UsageSources.AccountsOf` listing an agent's sign-ins *before* its default account: the row the user
named and can find in Settings is the better of the two to keep, and a machine with no sign-ins still
gets its default because nothing came before it.

**And the duplicate is dropped *before* the call, not after it** (`IAiAgent.UsageAccountKeyFor`,
`UsageSources.OnePerLogin`). Merging the reports kept the second card off the screen and left the second
request in place: one subscription asked twice a round with one token, which is most of what the usage
endpoint's 429s were — and a 429 takes the *good* row's figures down with it, so the deduplication that
was only cosmetic became the thing that made the tile wrong. The key is the same rule the report
carries, asked of the same files, because the two answering differently would either draw one login
twice or drop the only card of one. It reads nothing but this machine: a question asked to decide
whether to ask a question must not itself be a request. `AiUsageService.Explain` and the tile's own
merge stay as they are — a metered key names no login, and the doubt keeps costing a call rather than a
card.

**A 200 in the wrong shape is a failure, not an empty card.** `OpenRouterProvider.UsageAsync` answers
`AiUsageReport.Failed` when the answer carries no `data` object: built as an ordinary report it came out
`Answered`, with three window labels and not one figure under them — which is the "card that says
nothing" the type exists to prevent, reached by the quiet half of the same fault whose loud half
(`TryGetProperty` throwing on a non-object) was guarded first.

`UsagePace` is the pure part and is argued in a table test: elapsed time comes from **`ResetsAt -
Length`**, never from the day of the week — Claude's and codex's seven-day windows roll, so "it is
Wednesday, therefore 43%" is wrong by up to a day, and the same subtraction then serves the five-hour
window for free. Three states with a **dead band** of three points, because without it the label flips
between two words every refresh for the one account there is nothing to say about. The projection is
answered only where the rate runs out **inside** the window: a slower rate outlasts its own reset, so
there is nothing to warn about — and that is also what keeps a rate of almost nothing from overflowing a
`TimeSpan` on its way to a date in the year 40 000.

`AiUsageService` is one asker for the whole application, built in `App.axaml.cs` beside
`DatabaseServiceManager`: it enumerates the accounts (`UsageSources`, behind `IUsageSource` so the
service knows nothing about agents, providers or sign-ins), asks them in parallel, caches for three
minutes, records into `UsageHistory` and raises `Changed`. Two usage tiles in two workspaces are one set
of calls. **The timer runs only while at least one tile is attached** (`Attach`), the rule
discovery already follows: nothing here polls a service the user is not looking at. The in-flight handle
is a `TaskCompletionSource` published *before* the work starts, because with every source answering from
a cache the work finishes before it returns — a handle assigned from the return value is one assigned
after the run has already cleared it, and the service then reports a refresh in flight for good.

**Three rules there are about the clock and all three were wrong once.** The timer ticks at **half**
`RefreshInterval`, because a timer whose period equals the guard's window drops every other tick: the
period runs from one firing to the next while `_lastRefresh` is stamped when the work *finishes*, so at
the following tick the elapsed time is the interval less the round's duration, the guard says "still
current", and a dashboard documented as its interval was twice it. A round has its own deadline
(`RoundTimeout`) because the answers are published together and one account on a hanging socket held
every card at its previous figures for as long as *that instance's* timeout allowed — an OpenRouter
instance can be configured to a minute, and its usage call is two requests. And a **forced refresh
queues behind the round in flight rather than joining it**: joining is what made the button look
broken, since a round that began before whatever the user just changed — a sign-in they finished
logging into, a key they pasted — answers a different question, and its result reads on screen as a
press that did nothing. Not started alongside it either, or two rounds write `_reports` and the winner
is whichever finishes last rather than whichever asked last.

**Nothing asked is not nothing found.** `UsageTileViewModel.IsEmpty` is false until `LastRefresh` is
set, so "No account here reports limits." — a statement about the machine — is not the first thing every
usage tile says while the first round is still running.

**codex is read newest-first until one file answers, and by the newest line that _parses_.**
`rate_limits` is a substring, so a conversation *about* rate limits puts it in a message event, which
then stood in for the reading and had the card report no limits with the figures a line above it; and a
session opened a minute ago has written its file and had no reply yet, so asking the newest file alone
threw away the good reading from the session before it. The walk is bounded (`RolloutsExamined`) —
that directory holds every conversation ever had on this machine.

On screen it is **a readout, not a document**: full-bleed in the card, everything in the terminal's own
`TerminalFontFamily`, no chips and no second frame. Monospace is what puts the figures in a column down
the card without a grid holding them there, and it makes the tile read as part of the same instrument as
the terminal beside it. An account's name is a **section heading with a rule running to the edge**,
which is also what separates one account from the next — no boxes, no gap doing the job.

**A bar is a row of cells and the clock's share is a line between two of them** (`Views/UsageBar.cs`, a
control rather than converters doing arithmetic in the markup): cells of a fixed size, so two bars are
compared by counting rather than by measuring, and any spending at all lights the first one — rounding
would otherwise swallow every figure under half a cell, which on a sixteen-cell bar is three per cent.
Cells past the clock's mark are the danger colour and are the only colour on this tile carrying meaning,
so one glance answers *am I overspending* without a second widget. **The mark is a line in the gap
rather than a cell of its own, and that is a correction**: as a differently-coloured cell it could only
be drawn where the fill had not reached, so it disappeared under the fill at the one moment it is worth
looking for — leaving the accent-to-danger boundary as the only evidence of where the clock is, which is
legible once you know to look for it and invisible until then. The gutter belongs to no cell, so the
line survives being overtaken and both states carry the same marker. The arithmetic behind it is pure
and pinned by a table test. **A money account has no
bar at all**, so what its row carries is the amount, beside the window it belongs to — summarising one
window into a line under the card left the other two nowhere on screen. Empty
state is a fact rather than an error — most CLIs and most services publish nothing — with a button
opening Settings → AI.

**The name gets its own line; every window shares the next one, at any width.** The rule under the name
does the separating a box or a gap would otherwise have to, and it is also what lets the figures start
at the tile's own left margin instead of after however long the account happens to be called. Below it
the windows share the line in equal proportions (`UniformGrid Rows="1"`), so two accounts with the same
windows line their figures up down the tile — and proportional is what makes "one line" true without a
threshold anybody had to choose: everything narrows together, and the bar, being the only part of a
window with nothing else in it, is what runs out first. `UsageBar` draws whole cells and simply stops
drawing when there is no room for one, so a narrow tile loses the picture and keeps every figure — no
visibility rule, no width to pick.

**Below the width that trick runs out at, the windows go down the card instead** (`Views/UsageLayout.cs`,
`Views/UsageWindowsPanel.cs`). Losing the bar buys room down to about a window's label and its widest
figure (`13% · 2h 26m`); past that the shared line starts cutting the figure itself — which is the one
part of the row the rule above promises to keep — and in a column beside a terminal it was cutting it
mid-character. Down the card, a window gets the tile's whole width and the bar comes back with it.

**Down the card is not one window per line, and the bar is what decides.** A window with a bar takes a
line to itself, because the bar is the only part of the row with nothing in it and therefore the part a
shared line starves first. A window answered in money has no bar at all — `today: $0.41` is eighty pixels
of text — so it **wraps** beside the last one, which is four lines of a metered key's card turned into
two. **What is left on the key is the last item of that same flow**, not something docked to the end of
it: docked is where it belongs and is exactly why it was the one figure that could not wrap, so a
stacked metered card put its windows on two lines and then spent a third on `left: $4.14`. It is
written the way the windows beside it are — a muted name, a bright figure — so it is now the same kind
of thing. `UsageWindowsPanel` is where all three shapes live (equal shares across one line, a line to itself,
wrapped) because equal shares are the one thing a `WrapPanel` cannot do: it packs to the left, and equal
shares are what line two accounts' figures up down the tile. It asks the **item** whether it has a bar
rather than the container it sits in — a child there is the item's presenter, whose own alignment says
nothing about what the template drew, and both shapes measure to much the same width when asked with no
constraint.

The threshold is **derived rather than chosen**: what has to fit is a window's parts times however many
things the busiest account puts on its line — a bar's worth of width where anything on the tile draws
one, and a metered row's where nothing does, so a machine whose only account is a key does not stack at a
width its rows fit in. An account with two windows therefore stays horizontal in a column where one with
four cannot. **The label is measured and not assumed**, because it was written for `7d` and agy names two
families of models — the family is in every one of its four labels (`Claude and GPT 7d`), which at the old
threshold shared a line at widths where the label took what the figure needed and the clip ate the figure,
the exact failure this rule exists to prevent. The rule is pure and argued in a table test; the view reads
its own width and the view model says only how many items there are, how long the longest label is and
whether any draws a bar, because those are facts about the answers and not about the drawing. The tile is the only thing that
knows how much room it was given, so nothing above it is asked and nothing is persisted — the shape is
recomputed from `Bounds`, and a control that has not been measured yet stays horizontal rather than
starting stacked and springing sideways on its first layout pass.

What came off the rows is the point of the tile being a dashboard rather than a report. **The pace has
no words on screen at all** — "on pace" and "13 points spare" under every bar was a line of prose per
window per account, a number on every point, which is the thing a reader stops seeing; the state worth
acting on is already there without words, as fill past the tick in the danger colour and the figure
beside it in the same, and the sentence is in the row's tooltip. **The reset shows the countdown and
not the clock time** (`3h 43m`, with `resets 13:10 · in 3h 43m` in the tooltip): the instant is the half
that survives the card being looked at later, the wait is the half a glance is for. The percentage and
the countdown are **one string in one column**, because three columns to align carried two facts. The
per-card timestamp is gone — the tile's own header has the refresh time, and repeating it on four cards
buried the one stamp that differs, which is the stale one. And there is no "Usage" heading inside the tile: the tile header above already says it.

## Dictation

Speak into a tile instead of typing: a microphone button in the terminal tile's header and a
push-to-talk shortcut (**Alt+Space** by default). Recognition runs **entirely on this machine** — no
audio and no transcript leaves it. Ported from [cjpais/Handy](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy).

**The shortcut can be somebody else's already, and that is asked rather than waited out.** Measured
2026-09-12: `Alt+Space` is KRunner's on Plasma 6 and `activate-window-menu` on GNOME, and because the
gesture is a handler on our own window, a compositor holding it means the keys simply never arrive.
Windows is a written-down table rather than a question, since it publishes no register — and what goes in
it is only what the window never receives, which `Alt+Space` is not: there the key-down arrives and
`DefWindowProc` is what opens the window menu. `DesktopShortcuts` names the culprit where the desktop
will say, the wizard's twelve-second hint still covers every desktop that will not, and neither ever
claims a shortcut is free.

Microphone → 16 kHz mono `float` → speech engine → cleaned text → `TerminalControl.SendText`. Two
engines behind `ISpeechToTextEngine`, chosen by the model: **Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3** on ONNX Runtime
(the default — 25 languages worked out by itself, and faster on a CPU than any whisper of comparable
accuracy) and **whisper.cpp** through Whisper.net for the ggml models. Nothing ships with the
application; a three-step wizard (model → microphone → test) sets it up on a first run and from
Settings → Speech. The last step is where the **shortcut** is taught, by being used — *Hold `Alt`
`Space` and say something* — rather than on a page of its own: the transcript that comes back proves the
model, the microphone and the shortcut at once, and a page that only let somebody type a combination and
click Next would prove nothing about it. Changing it there is a capture mode lasting exactly one
keystroke; "no shortcut" is offered out loud; the Record button stays as the fallback for a shortcut the
desktop has taken.

**Everything else is in [`docs/DICTATION.md`](docs/DICTATION.md)** — the pipeline in detail, the
threading rules, the download and unpacking, the shortcut's state machine, the model comparison for
Polish, and the reasoning behind each. Read it before changing anything under `Services/Speech/`: most
of what is written there is a bug that has already been paid for once.

## The phone: following agents, and dictating, from anywhere

A paired phone is a remote for the whole window: every workspace, each one's layout drawn to scale, and
any tile zoomed into — an Agent or a Goal tile's conversation as it happens, with its approvals, questions
and plan to answer; a terminal's screen as text with the arrows, Escape and Enter; typing; hold-to-talk
dictation into that tile; and whatever actions the tile offers a phone. A QR button beside Settings, in
the workspaces panel, pairs one.

**Nothing listens to the network.** Both ends dial out to Tailscale's public DERP relays through
[tailcat-link](https://github.com/b-y-t-e/tailcat-link) (`Tailcat.Link` on NuGet; its browser client is
vendored into `site/phone/vendor/`), which pass end-to-end encrypted bytes between two public keys. No
port, no certificate, no firewall rule, and the phone need not share a network with the machine. This
replaced a Kestrel HTTPS server, self-signed and Tailscale certificates, a Windows firewall repair and an
address ranker — all of which existed only because a port had to be opened and then found. ADR
[0006](docs/adr/0006-phone-over-relays.md) is the reasoning.

What is worth knowing before touching `Services/Phone/` or `site/phone/`:

- **The page is a static site on GitHub Pages** (`site/phone/`, `.github/workflows/pages.yml`,
  `PhoneSettings.PageUrl` — not on any settings page; `node site/phone/serve.mjs` serves a local copy).
  A browser gives the microphone and WebCrypto only to a secure origin, and with no port mTiles cannot
  serve one. The **invitation code rides in the URL fragment**, which never reaches the server; the page
  pairs and takes it out of the address bar. The DERP map must be same-origin, so the workflow copies it
  in on every deploy and weekly. **Pages has to be enabled in the repository (source: GitHub Actions).**
- **An injected script on that origin is a shell on the paired machine**, since the pairing lives in its
  IndexedDB. So: a strict CSP in `index.html`, nothing loaded from anywhere else (tweetnacl and the font
  are vendored), and **never `innerHTML`** — `markdown.js` parses into plain objects and builds elements
  through `textContent`, links only for http/https. `site/phone/test/` pins it; CI runs it with `node --test`.
- **A phone names the tile it means** (`tileId` on every request) and what each phone watches is pushed
  to it (`PhoneProtocol`: requests answered `{ok,…}`, pushes as notifications, `hello` exchanging a
  protocol version because page and application ship separately). Pushes are **sampled, not evented** —
  four times a second while a phone is connected, only for a tile whose `IRemoteViewTile.RemoteVersion`
  moved, and never a message identical to the last one sent.
- **What a tile shows is the tile's own answer** (`ViewModels/IRemoteViewTile.cs`, see `docs/TILES.md`):
  the Agent tile projects the `ConversationState` its transcript draws from (`AgentChatProjection`), the
  Goal tile its messages and the block it waits on (`GoalTileViewModel.Remote.cs`), a terminal its screen
  as text (`TerminalControl.ReadScreenText`, Terminal.Avalonia 0.4.2 — the last frame, not the stream that
  drew it). Commands go through the tile's own commands and are checked against what it waits on *now*.
  `PhoneTileActions` is still the one filter for what a phone is shown and may press: nothing destructive.
- **Audio is one channel per utterance** — a JSON header (tile, sample rate), 16-bit PCM, a one-byte
  zero frame to cancel, and the channel closing on purpose to end the sentence; ended with the session
  it is a cancel. Ordered within itself, which a request followed by frames would not be.
- **`IAudioCapture` is the seam.** `PhoneAudioCapture` implements it and `RoutedAudioCapture` picks
  between it and the microphone per recording, so `DictationService` gained a second input without
  gaining a line of code.
- **The link runs when a phone is paired** (`PhoneSettings.HasPairedDevices`, written by the bridge),
  when *Keep connected* is on, or while the panel is open — a machine that never paired one never dials a
  relay. At most four devices; a code is single use and lives five minutes; Unpair is `ForgetPeerAsync`, and a phone can log itself out (`unpair`, answered first and forgotten a second later, since forgetting drops the session the answer travels on).
  The end-to-end test runs over `Tailcat.TestSupport`'s in-memory relay (`PhoneLinkTests`);
  `PhoneLivePageTests` (opt-in, `MTILES_LIVE_PHONE`) hosts over the real relays for a browser to drive.

**Everything else is in [`docs/DICTATION.md`](docs/DICTATION.md) → *Dictating from a phone***.

## Restart shell

`RestartTerminalAsync` in `LeafTileNodeViewModel` — relaunches the tile through `TileLauncher.Launch` (which replaces the session; nothing kills it first). Available via the Restart icon in the tile header and Ctrl+Shift+R.

It was introduced as a workaround for the ConPTY hang after Ctrl+C in TUI apps (an opencode bug on Windows). **That reason is gone** — it was the in-box `conhost.exe` crashing, and the terminal control now ships OpenConsole. The command stays as a feature.

## Scrollbar Fluent theme fix

`AppTheme.axaml` overrides `VerticalSmallScrollThumbScaleTransform` / `HorizontalSmallScrollThumbScaleTransform` to `none`. Without this, the Fluent theme scales the thumb to 12.5% on machines with the default Windows "auto-hide scrollbars" setting.

## Shutting down

**Closing the last window does not raise `ShutdownRequested`.** Avalonia raises that for a shutdown it
is *asked* about — the session ending, a programmatic `TryShutdown` — while closing the last window
shuts the lifetime down directly. Everything `App` starts outside the window (the phone bridge, the
dictation service, the database bridge, the usage service, the file sync, the text-scale watcher) hung
off that event alone, so on the one exit every user takes none of it ran: what saved us was the process
leaving and the operating system taking the sockets back with it. That is a rescue and not a shutdown,
and it stops working the moment the process is slow to leave — the database bridge's port is registered
with **http.sys**, which keeps listening for exactly as long as the process lives, which is the port
still open after the window has gone.

`App.ReleaseBackgroundServices` is therefore called from both routes and is idempotent: from
`MainWindow.OnClosing` **after `DisposeAll`** (a tile on its way out still speaks to the database
manager) and from `ShutdownRequested` for the session-end path that never closes a window. `DbHttpServer.Stop`
now writes a line into the db-log, because when the next launch reports the port taken that line is the
only way to tell a bridge that was never closed from one that was.

**"Port N is used by System" names the mechanism and never the culprit.** Every `HttpListener` prefix
is registered with http.sys, which listens inside the System process (pid 4) on the registrant's
behalf, so every conflict — including this application's own — reads that way in `netstat`.
`DatabaseServiceManager.DetectPortConflict` says what is actually holding it instead: another copy of
this application, named by process id, or one that has not finished exiting.

## Crash handling and logging

`CrashHandler` catches exceptions from three sources: `AppDomain.UnhandledException`, `TaskScheduler.UnobservedTaskException`, `Dispatcher.UIThread.UnhandledException`. Initialized in `Program.Main()` before Avalonia starts.

`FileLogWriter` writes logs to `%APPDATA%/mTiles/logs/mtiles-YYYY-MM-DD.log` with automatic cleanup of files older than 7 days. `LogTraceListener` redirects `Trace` to log files.

## Persistence

- `%APPDATA%/mTiles/` (Windows) or `~/.config/mTiles/` (Linux). Renamed from `MTerminal`, and `AppPaths` **moves** the old directory into place on first use rather than leaving it: everything the user has is in there, and the first run *saves*, so a fresh path would have written defaults over a reachable installation within milliseconds. A move that fails keeps using the old path — a locked file must not become a lost installation
- `settings.json` — everything in Settings, the configured `AiProviderInstances` (**not** seeded — an empty list means nothing has been set up, rather than six services none of which work — with the key encrypted the way the database passwords are), the seeded `AiAgentInstances` (one per agent, added and
  never replaced, so a rename or a repointed provider survives every launch and an agent shipped by a
  later version still gets its row, and seeded on **`auto`** where the agent has that gate and on
  `ToolDefault` (no flag) where it has not (`AiAgentCatalog.DefaultBehaviourFor` — the user's call,
  2026-09-23, reversing the earlier all-`ToolDefault` seeding for new rows only — an existing row is
  never moved, since a row on `ToolDefault` may be somebody's decision to keep the tool asking); its `DefaultBehaviour`/`DefaultEffort` are read through the tolerant converters
  for the reason `GoalPermissionMode` is, the behaviour falling to `ToolDefault` rather than `Auto` so an
  unreadable answer is never *more* permissive than the one it replaced), the configured `AiSignIns` (**not** seeded, and the one list here with **no secret in it** — a name
  and a location, so nothing to blank on export and nothing to restore on import; the login itself stays
  in the CLI's own directory under `agents/`), plus window state and the database configuration (passwords DPAPI-encrypted). Renaming a key here is a migration: the old one stops being read and the user silently gets the new default, which is why `GitHideMTerminalDir`, `GitIgnoreMTerminalDir` and `Speech.HotkeyEnabled` are still parsed once (`SettingsService.MigrateLegacySettings`). The first two are the same question under three names — the application was renamed under it — and they are applied oldest first so the **newest** answer wins: with three generations, "the oldest wins" stops being caution and becomes an answer nobody can change. Every section and collection **refuses a null in its own setter**: a property initialiser does not survive deserialisation, and `"Speech": null` is not an error the load's own catch would see — it is a `NullReferenceException` while the main window is being built, so the application does not start and says nothing about why. The guard is on the property rather than a normalisation pass after loading, because a pass only ever covers the level somebody remembered: `"Speech": { "CustomWords": null }` walked straight past one and stopped startup just the same. **Strings are covered by type rather than one at a time** — `NullToEmptyStringConverter`, registered on `JsonDefaults.SettingsOptions` (the settings file's own options, not the shared ones, because elsewhere a null string may be meant), with `ProtectedStringConverter.HandleNull` covering the encrypted ones a property-level converter would otherwise hide. Hand-guarding had reached four properties out of dozens. `SettingsNullGuardTests` now *walks* the settings graph from `AppSettings` (through collection element types too) instead of listing three types, which is how `PostgreSqlDiscoverySettings.Ports` — a startup crash one hop below where anyone was looking — stayed unguarded. The converter also **overrules `string?`**, and cannot do otherwise: it is chosen by type and never told which property it fills, so a nullable property still arrives empty from the file. Both such properties (`LastWorkspaceId`, `RequiredAiToolBinaryName`) are read through `IsNullOrEmpty`, so it costs nothing — and the list is pinned by a test, because that is true by inspection rather than by construction.
  **DPAPI is Windows-only, so on every other platform those keys and passwords are in this file as plain
  text** — which is why it, and every `settings.bad-*` copy of it, is written owner-only through
  `PrivateFile` (`0600`; a no-op on Windows, where the file inherits `%APPDATA%`'s ACL), and why the
  words on the AI page come from `SecretStorage` rather than from the markup: the key field used to
  promise "stored encrypted on this machine" on Linux too, with nothing but a `Trace` line saying
  otherwise, and that sentence is what the user weighs the risk against.
  **An unreadable file is copied aside before it is overwritten** (`settings.bad-<timestamp>.json`, newest five kept). "Treat it as a first run" is only half the story: the first-run steps save, so within milliseconds the user's agent instances, provider keys and database passwords are replaced by defaults — and "unreadable" is often a truncation with most of the content intact
- `workspaces.json` — list of workspaces (id, name, path)
- `window/layout.json` — the window's own tile layout (`WindowLayoutViewModel`): the list of workspaces, the place the open workspace is drawn and whatever note, todo or usage tiles sit beside them. **Not written until something is moved** — the default is the window as it looked before it had a layout — and a file that does not hold the list and the workspace exactly once each is replaced by that default rather than mended. A window-level note or todo list keeps its file under `window/.mtiles/`, because `window/` is what those tiles are handed in place of a workspace directory
- `agent-conversations/conversations.db` — every Agent tile's conversation: its events and the id that
  resumes it (SQLite, `SqliteConversationStore`). The directory is owner-only, because what is in it is
  prompts, answers and diffs of somebody's code, and SQLite writes `-wal`/`-shm` beside the file where no
  create mode on the file would reach. Nothing prunes it yet — which now costs more, because a closed
  tile's conversation is reachable from any Agent tile in that workspace rather than an orphan
- `workspaces/{id}.json` — tile layout per workspace (shell name, agent instance id, tile id, tile name). Backward compat: `RootPane` → `RootTile` migration in `WorkspaceState`, and `TerminalAgentTileMigration` turning the terminal leaves that were an AI CLI in a shell into agent leaves — `{id}.pre-agents.json` is the copy taken before the first save in the new shape, and it has the same expiry date as the migration
- `logs/` — application logs (daily files, 7-day retention)
- `sessions/opencode/ses_<tileId>.json` — the import document an OpenCode tile creates its session from (see Session resume). Rewritten on every launch; a few hundred bytes, and deliberately never pruned — while the file exists, a session the user threw away can be recreated on the next launch
- `opencode/<instanceId>.opencode.json` — the provider document an opencode instance on a **local**
  server is launched with (`OpenCodeProviderConfig`, pointed at by `OPENCODE_CONFIG`). Same category and
  same rules as the session import above it: derived from the instance's id, rewritten on every launch
  so an address edited in Settings takes effect without anything having to notice, and never pruned. No
  secret of *ours* in it — the providers that need one have no key. It is the user's own opencode
  config with our provider block added, though (overwriting it would take their default model, MCP
  servers and instructions away from the tile), so a key they keep in **their** file is copied here:
  owner-only, on this machine, and outside what `SettingsPortability` exports
- `agents/<agentId>/<signInId>/` — one AI CLI login each, written by the CLI itself and pointed at
  through its own environment variable. **Contains a refresh token and the whole conversation history
  that came with the account**, so it is created owner-only and nothing in this application ever deletes
  one: removing the sign-in row removes the row
- `goal-logs/goal-YYYY-MM-DD-<goal id>.log` — the whole of what one Goal tile did: every prompt as it
  was actually sent, every answer as it came back, the verdict each was given, every phase change,
  parse, salvage round, baseline, commit and stop reason (`GoalLog`). **Deliberately not in
  `logs/`** — these are whole prompts and whole answers, and in the daily log they would bury every
  other line in it. One file per tile per day, pruned by the same `AppDefaults.LogRetentionDays` sweep,
  owner-only through `PrivateFile` because a prompt carries this project's diff and an answer carries
  the code the tool wrote. Always on, off the caller's thread, and every failure swallowed: a log that
  cannot be written must never be a goal that stops. See [`docs/GOAL.md`](docs/GOAL.md)
- `usage/history.json` — the daily spending snapshots
  (`UsageHistory`): `{ sourceId: { "2026-09-01": 18.09, … } }`, 60 days kept, owner-only through
  `PrivateFile` because it is a record of what somebody's accounts cost. **These are ours and nobody
  else's** — OpenRouter's `api/v1/activity` answers 403 for an ordinary key, so there is no per-day
  history to fetch from anyone. **Nothing on screen reads it**: the card shows what is *left* on a key,
  not what each of the last seven days cost. The recording stays because it is the only per-day history
  that exists at all, it costs a few kilobytes, and a row of bars that starts empty is worth having
  already filled in if it ever comes back. The day is **UTC**, because that
  is the boundary the counter being sampled resets on, and the **maximum** seen for a date wins: the
  value is a running daily total, so a poll landing just after midnight would otherwise write a fresh
  small number over a finished day. An unreadable file is a fresh start — what is lost is a row of bars
- `usage/last.json` — each account's last good usage reading and any `Retry-After` still in force
  (`UsageSnapshots`), so a restart during a 429 neither asks again nor loses the card. A restored
  reading is always stamped with its age (`AiUsageReport.HeldOver`). Owner-only, like `history.json`
- `models/` — downloaded speech-to-text models (hundreds of MB each; `.partial` while downloading)
- `phone/` — `mtiles-phone.link.json`: the phone link's identity and its paired devices, written by tailcat-link — the private key DPAPI-protected on Windows, the file `0600` elsewhere. Shutting the application down does not unpair anything; Unpair in the panel does. The Kestrel bridge's `bridge.pfx` (a private key) and `sessions.json` are deleted on first start

## What is not built yet

[`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md) — the things known to be missing, each with what is wrong now, what
the stopgap is and what would settle it. Two of them are decisions somebody will otherwise make again
from scratch: why the model fields are an `AutoCompleteBox` and not an editable `ComboBox` (measured,
both are wrong in opposite directions), and what a tile header of an index, a kind and a description
would take. The user-facing half of the same list is the **Roadmap** section of `README.md`; this one
carries the reasoning.

## Architecture decision records

Important decisions are recorded as ADRs in `docs/adr/`, one file per decision:
`NNNN-short-title.md`, numbered in order and never renumbered. Write one whenever a choice is
non-obvious, costs something, or reverses an earlier one — a default forced on every tile, a
trade-off against a user-visible feature, a workaround for another program's behaviour. Each ADR says
what the situation was (**Context**), what was decided (**Decision**), what it costs and gains
(**Consequences**), and, when the decision replaces earlier ones, their dates (**History**). Link the
ADR from the code it governs, so the next person to touch that line finds the reason before changing it.
A decision that is later reversed gets a new ADR; the old one is marked *superseded by NNNN*, not
deleted.

Recorded so far:
- [0001](docs/adr/0001-claude-code-fullscreen-renderer.md) — Claude Code runs on its fullscreen
  renderer in every tile (`CLAUDE_CODE_NO_FLICKER=1`); the classic one breaks the scrollback on resize.
- [0002](docs/adr/0002-handing-work-across-a-change-of-agent.md) — picking another agent hands the work
  over with a brief instead of being refused; the resume token is cleared at the seam, and the permission
  mode travels with the work, bypass included.
- [0003](docs/adr/0003-effort-by-role-in-a-goal-run.md) — a Goal run thinks by role rather than at one
  level: the strip's one word is a preset, the commit is `low` as a constant nothing can set, and
  planning joins review as a slot that may be another agent. Reverses `AiEffort`'s "high by default
  because the budget is in attempts". Its default preset is amended by 0004.
- [0005](docs/adr/0005-an-output-proxy-per-agent-instance.md) — the token proxy (rtk) is a tick on an
  agent instance carried by a generated `--settings` file, never `rtk init --global` patching the
  user's own; the agent says whether it has a route, and opencode's is named and refused.
- [0004](docs/adr/0004-a-rung-below-the-default-review.md) — the ladder gains a rung between `cheap`
  and the old default: `balanced` now means a review at medium, and the deep review keeps its levels
  under the name `careful`. The word moved, so a stored `Balanced` is migrated onto `careful` under a
  key of its own rather than silently meaning something cheaper.
- [0006](docs/adr/0006-phone-over-relays.md) — the phone reaches mTiles through Tailscale's public
  relays (tailcat-link) instead of a Kestrel server on this machine: no port, no certificate, no firewall;
  the page moves to GitHub Pages with the pairing code in the URL fragment.

## Conventions

- **Workspace** (not "project") — working directory with terminal/editor tiles. Right-click on workspace → context menu (Show in Explorer, Remove).
- **Tile** (not "pane"/"panel") — a single tile in a workspace (terminal, note, or todo), split into a binary tree
- **Note** (not "editor") — tile with text editor (AvaloniaEdit), kind id `note`
- **Todo** — tile with task list, kind id `todo`
- ViewModels in `ViewModels/`, views in `Views/`
- **Terminal agent** — a terminal whose commands are an AI CLI's own rather than a script the user
  wrote, kind id `agent` (the id predates the Agent tile and is on people's disks, so the class names
  carry the distinction instead: `TerminalAgentTileKind`, `TerminalAgentTileViewModel`,
  `TerminalAgentTileMigration`). **Agent** is the other tile — the same CLI held as a conversation, kind
  id `agent-conversation`, `AgentConversation*` in code; see *Agent conversation tile* above.
  `TerminalAgentTileViewModel` derives from `TerminalTileViewModel` and overrides two answers:
  where the commands come from (`IAiAgent.Interactive`, asked at every launch so an instance edited
  in Settings takes effect on the next restart) and what the layout calls it. The tile stores the
  `AiAgentInstance`'s id, the agent's id beside it (a deleted instance leaves a tile that still
  starts, on the same agent) and — for `SessionStrategy.CapturedAfterStart` only — the session id
  the agent named itself, together with the tile identity it was captured under, so "New session"
  cannot reopen the conversation the user has just left. **A tile that could not be built as it was
  configured says so and keeps asking for what it was** (`AgentSubstitution`, set by
  `TerminalAgentTileKind.Resolve`, shown once as `TerminalTileViewModel.LaunchNotice` — dismissible, because
  unlike `LaunchProblem` this tile *is* running): the last two links of the fallback chain can land on a
  different agent, and a Codex tile that quietly comes back as Claude is a different program working in
  somebody's repository. `Save` therefore writes the **requested** ids rather than the substitute's — the
  layout is saved for any reason at all, so the substitution would otherwise become permanent within
  seconds of the tile opening and restoring the instance in Settings would no longer bring it back — and
  it writes no session id while a tile is substituted, since that id belongs to the agent standing in.
  **It draws the Agent tile's context bar** (`ContextGaugeViewModel`, one class for both kinds, and
  `Border.context-bar` in `Controls.axaml`): the same figure about the same conversation, differing only
  in where it is read from — the Agent tile is told it by the protocol it drives, this one reads it out
  of the CLI's own store. **The bar is off by default** (`AppSettings.ShowContextBar`, Settings → General): with it off the reading moves into the tile's header as one word (`42%`, `IContextReadingTile`) and nothing is lost. **With it on, the row is there from the first frame**, reading `context not known yet`
  wherever a reading can ever arrive (`ContextGaugeViewModel.KeepsItsPlace`, asked of the agent's own
  `SessionLog`) — the Agent tile's rule, and here it is about the terminal rather than the figure: a row
  that appears with the first reading pushes the terminal up one line mid-turn, which remeasures the
  cell grid and reflows the shell. An agent whose CLI keeps nothing readable (agy, Grok) draws no bar
  at all, since the sentence would otherwise stand there for the life of the session. The bar and the figures are hidden separately, because four of the five CLIs
  that count tokens never name the window and the denominator then comes from the provider
  (the instance's own `MaxContextTokens` first, then `ModelContextWindow.ContextOfAsync` — deliberately
  ungated, unlike `ResolveAsync`, which asks what to put in *Claude Code's environment* — and then the
  agent's own account, `IAiAgent.AccountContextWindowAsync`, which is the only route a **subscription**
  has, since it carries no provider instance at all. `ClaudeModelCatalog` is the one implementation:
  `GET api.anthropic.com/v1/models` with the CLI's own OAuth token, `max_input_tokens` and never
  `max_tokens`, measured 2026-09-18). **And nothing after that**: falling back to the 200 000 the CLI
  documents itself as assuming drew a full bar over a conversation of 234k on `claude-opus-5`, whose
  window is 1 000 000 — one account serves opus-5 a million tokens and opus-4.5 two hundred thousand, so
  no constant is right, and a bar pinned at 100% reads as *about to run out*. The Agent tile fills the
  window in the same order and at the same moment (`WithAWindow`), because only codex and ACP report one
  over the wire. A plain shell answers `null` to `TerminalTileViewModel.ContextGauge`
  and loses no line to it.
  `TileKindIds.ToLegacy` answers `terminal`
  for it: a build Velopack has rolled back opens the leaf as a plain shell on the shell it was
  running (hence a `shellName` in its state this build never reads) rather than as an empty tile.
  `TileLauncher` gained the two moments a session needs — `PrepareForLaunchAsync` before the
  commands are resolved (agy's pre-create, which *makes* the conversation the tile then resumes)
  and `OnLaunched(startedAt)` after they start (codex's rollout file, polled for half a minute
  because it does not exist until the session does — `IAiAgent.CapturesWhileRunning` is which of
  the two an agent needs). A capture that fails costs a conversation, never a tile.
- **Git** — tile with change viewer (diff, commit, stash, push, fetch, tags, undo, context menu, discard), kind id `git`
- **Database** — tile with database management (SQL Server, PostgreSQL), HTTP bridge, query logs, kind id `database`
- **Usage** — a read-only dashboard of what every account this machine can actually ask has left, kind
  id `usage`. See *Usage tile* below
- No DI container — manual injection in `App.axaml.cs`, where `BuildTileCatalog` is also the one place a kind of tile is registered
- **ConfirmAction pattern** — destructive actions (discard, remove workspace, undo commit) use `Func<string, Task<bool>>? ConfirmAction` in ViewModel, wired from View as `MessageBox.Avalonia` dialog (YesNo). **An unwired dialog normally lets the action through** — except in Settings, where it does not. `SettingsView.ConfirmAction` answers **no** when there is no window to ask in, and that covers *every* confirmation on that dialog: deleting a manual database connection, a downloaded speech model. An unanswered question is not a yes, and nothing on that dialog is cheap to undo — a speech model is hundreds of megabytes and, on a slow connection, hours. The speech model's own chain says no at all three links (the row, the tab that wires it, the view), and all three had to change together: a `?? Task.FromResult(true)` in the middle made the row's own refusal unreachable
- **PromptInput pattern** — `Func<string, string, IEnumerable<string>?, Task<string?>>? PromptInput` in ViewModel, wired from View as `InputDialog` (title + text input + suggestions list). Used e.g. when creating a tag.
- **ShowError pattern** — `Func<string, string, Task>? ShowError` in ViewModel, wired from View as `MessageBox.Avalonia` (Ok). Used for push/fetch/tag/undo errors.

## Git tile — details

`GitDirectoryWatcher` watches both `.git/` and the entire working directory (worktree). The list of ignored directories is retrieved from `git ls-files --ignored` and updated on every refresh. **The tile no longer owns one**: it takes a subscription on the workspace's `WorkspaceGitWatcher`, which the Goal tile also listens to, so one working copy is watched once however many tiles care — and the ignored directories it computes are its own contribution to a union that leaves when its subscription does. The watcher asks git for them itself as well, so a workspace holding a Goal tile alone does not watch its tree with an empty ignore list and turn every write into `obj/` during a build into a `git status`. `Error` handlers on watchers log buffer overflow and trigger a refresh.

`ReconcileChanges` in `GitTileViewModel` preserves checkbox state (`IsChecked`) between refreshes based on key (FilePath + Status + mtime). Two-level cache (currentState + previousState) protects against state loss with "flickering" files. On first load checkboxes = false, on subsequent refreshes new/changed files = true.

Context menu (right-click) on file list: Show in Explorer, Open in default program, Copy filename/folder/filepath, Discard changes (with confirmation dialog). Multi-select: right-click shows only Discard with file count. Space toggles checkboxes of selected files.

Context menu (right-click) on commit list: Add tag..., Copy commit hash.

**Push/Fetch/Undo:** Buttons in the Git tile tab bar. Push detects upstream (missing → `push -u origin`). Fetch runs `fetch --all --prune`. Undo = `reset --soft HEAD~1`, available only when the last commit is local (unpushed). All with error dialog.

**Tags:** Displayed in commit history (color `TagColor`). Created via context menu → `InputDialog` with list of recent tags. Name validation with regex `[a-zA-Z0-9._/\-]+`.

**Unpushed commits:** Marked with `*` (color `DangerText`) in history. Counter `(N)` next to the Push button. Logic: `git log upstream..HEAD`.

**Commit suggestions:** Popup at the commit message field (clock icon). Top-3 most frequent + 10 most recent unique from `git log --format=%s -50`.

**`.mtiles/` in `.gitignore`:** Setting `GitIgnoreWorkspaceDir` (default **on**) keeps `.mtiles/` listed in the workspace's `.gitignore`, applied on every Git tile refresh (`GitIgnoreFile`, `GitTileViewModel.ApplyWorkspaceIgnoreSettingAsync`, which also removes the old `.mterminal/` entry unconditionally — `WorkspacePaths` has moved that directory, and a `.gitignore` line for a directory that is not there is litter this application put in somebody else's repository). It replaced `GitHideMTerminalDir`, which only hid those files in this tile's list — leaving them untracked *and* unignored, so they were invisible here and waiting in every other git client.

Consequences worth knowing: **the app edits a file in the user's repository, and creates one where there is none** (a blank line, a `# mTiles workspace state` comment and the entry, appended; turning the setting off removes exactly those and nothing else). `GitIgnoreFile` works on raw bytes and only ever appends, so a BOM and any non-UTF-8 content survive; removal rewrites through a temporary file and a move. An emptied `.gitignore` is left in place rather than deleted — this cannot tell one it created from an empty one the user committed. It is written by the **Git tile**, so a workspace without one is untouched. Files already *committed* under `.mtiles/` now appear in the changes list, correctly — ignoring something git already tracks changes nothing. A user who had the old setting off keeps it off: `SettingsService.MigrateLegacySettings` reads the old `GitHideMTerminalDir` once and drops it. That case is the only one in which the app would edit a repository against a decision the user had already made.

**DiffFontSize:** Diff panel uses 80% of font size (`FontSize * 0.8`).

## Workspace view caching

`MainWindow` caches `WorkspaceView` instances in `Dictionary<string, WorkspaceView>`. Switching workspaces via `IsVisible` toggle instead of DataTemplate — terminals are not killed/recreated. `WorkspaceRemoved` event clears the cache and removes the view from the visual tree.

**The cache is the window's, and the window's layout only borrows it.** `MainWindow` builds the panel of cached workspace views once, and `CreateWindowTileView` hands it to a `WindowTileFrame` — no card, no header, a drop target and a hint overlay — for the workspace tile. **The list of workspaces is an ordinary card** (`LeafTileView`), with the header every tile has: its name, the split buttons, the `…` menu, no close button since it is permanent, and it is dragged by that header like any other tile. Its `WorkspacesPanelView` is kept on the tile's view model (`WorkspacesTileViewModel.CachedView`) so a card rebuilt when the tile moves re-parents the same list rather than building it again. A tile is added to the window by splitting one — the list's header included — and choosing Note, Todo or Usage in the empty tile; splitting the list along its fixed axis puts the new tile beside its column rather than inside its pixels (`TileTreeEdits.InsertIntoGutter`). The list's width is written back into `WorkspacesPanelWidth` on close so a rolled-back build opens it at that width.

## Workspace panel

`WorkspaceItemViewModel` — wrapper for `Workspace` with `ObservableProperty BranchName`. **The branch travels by a watcher, not by the timer**: each repository row watches its own `.git/HEAD` (`StartWatchingHead`, one file, not recursive — idempotent, since three places now start one, and watching `FileName` as well as `LastWrite`/`Size` with `Renamed`/`Created` handlers, because git writes `HEAD.lock` and renames it over `HEAD`, which Windows reports as a rename and not as a write), so a checkout in a terminal tile shows up within the debounce. The 30s `DispatcherTimer` is the safety net for the two things such a watcher cannot do — a repository that has appeared or gone, and a row whose watcher never started — and it asks the **file system** first, calling `GitService.ReadBranchNameAsync` only where the answer could have changed. **What it judges on is `.git/HEAD` itself, never the presence of a watcher** (`ReadHeadStamp`, the ref string the branch name is read out of, remembered per row against the last answer git gave): a `FileSystemWatcher` on a network share, on `\\wsl$` or on some virtual file systems stops delivering without ever raising `Error`, and a pass that skipped a row because an entry existed for it froze that branch for the life of the window — which is the one thing the old unconditional poll did not do. `ResolveGitDir` plus that read is a `Directory.Exists` and two small reads, so the goal of no `git` on a quiet list is kept without trusting the watcher to report its own silence. **One private method does the reading** (`ReadBranchIntoRowAsync`): the periodic pass, the watcher's debounce and a workspace just added all take the same four steps, and as three copies they had already drifted — the third asked git for a directory with no repository in it, a process and a logged exception every time somebody added an ordinary folder. Unforced it used to spawn one `git` per row every thirty seconds for the life of the window; a quiet list now costs no processes at all. `force: true` is the first pass and a repository just created. Two details keep the quiet list quiet: whether a row has ever been read is a flag of its own (`WorkspaceItemViewModel.BranchAnswered`) and never the emptiness of the name — a detached HEAD, a rebase and a bisect all answer with nothing, which read as "never read" is a `git` per tick for ever — and a watcher that reports an error is **removed** rather than only logged (`OnWatcherFailed`), because an entry left in the table counts as watching and would freeze that row's branch for the life of the window. Two more ways a row could freeze are closed the same way: a git that **could not be asked** answers `null` rather than an empty branch (`GitService.ReadBranchNameAsync` — a held `index.lock`, a network drive gone for a moment; an empty string is a detached HEAD and is an answer, `null` is not, and only an answer sets `BranchAnswered`), and the **directory each watcher stands on is kept beside it** and compared every pass, because a `.git` file can be repointed — a worktree moved, a submodule's gitdir replaced — and `FileSystemWatcher` reports no error for that: it goes on watching the old path in silence. Dispose in `MainWindowViewModel.OnClosing`.

**The panel has one left edge**: the scrollbar is on the right, where it does not push the list out of line with the filter box above it.

**The list takes three shapes, chosen by its tile's size and nothing else** (`WorkspacesPanelShapes.For`, pure and argued in a table test): rows, a strip of initials below 80 px wide, and a **row of tabs below 120 px tall** — which is what a list dropped along the top or the bottom of the window is, since that drop holds it at one strip (`WorkspacesTileKind.StripHeight`). By size rather than by where it was dropped, the rule the strip of initials already followed: nothing is stored, so nothing can disagree with the screen, and a list dragged tall again is rows again. Height outranks width, because a tile too short for rows cannot be a column of anything. A tab says the name and, a step back and trimmed first, the branch, with the activity marks and the pin; the path and the memory reading are for the other shapes and the tooltip. It wears the row's own classes — selected, hovered and unloaded look exactly as a row does — and `workspace-tab` only moves the accent from the leading edge to the bottom edge. The filter is a button opening the field, because a text box in a row of tabs takes the width of four of them, and the application's actions stand at the strip's far end. In every shape the list is dragged by its card's header, which is why a list along an edge is held at the header's height plus one row of tabs.

**The panel is a tile's card**, not a card of its own: the list is a tile of the window's layout, so its ground, radius, hairline and the header it is dragged and split by are the `LeafTileView` drawn round every tile, and `WorkspacesPanelView` has no chrome of its own — a second card inside that one was a frame inside a frame. It used to be the one flat slab in the application, running from the title bar to the taskbar beside a column of cards, which read as two applications sharing a window. The bottom actions (Settings, phone bridge, update — `WindowActionsBar`, one definition for all three shapes) are the application's rather than the list's, so a hairline separates them; the heading uses the application's own `TextBlock.section` class rather than a local set of font properties; and both levels of row share one `RadiusRow`, because nesting is said by the indent and the guide beside it and three radii in a 240px column say nothing at all.

**Selected is not hover.** Both were `InteractiveHover`, so pointing at a neighbour made it impossible to say which workspace was open — the one thing the list exists to tell you. Selected now gets `BgElevated` and an accent down its leading edge, the marker the tiles already use for the same idea.

**A row says what is going on in there, and can be pinned.** Two marks in one slot, never both (`Controls.axaml` → `workspace-busy`, 11px): a turning arc while a tile is **working**, and a still `AlertCircleOutline` in `DangerText` while one is **blocked** — stopped on a question and waiting for the user. The arc turns because what it reports is work in progress and a still mark cannot be told apart from a state somebody left switched on; the other one does not turn, and that is the whole message. The animation hangs off a second class (`.spinning`, applied from `IsWorking`) rather than off the base one: a style that matched always would keep an infinite animation ticking on every hidden spinner in the list — one per workspace, for the whole session. Both are fed by `WorkspaceViewModel.Activity`, the **strongest** answer any of its leaves gives (`Blocked > Working > Idle > Unknown`), which is why aggregating a state rather than or-ing a flag was worth it: a workspace where three tiles are building and one has stopped for permission is a workspace that needs somebody *now*, and reported as "working" it looks like the three that can be left alone. Where the answer comes from is *Tile activity* below. Only workspaces that have been opened have a view model, so an unopened one stays `Unknown` — truthfully, since nothing of it is running and nothing has been asked. The star writes `Workspace.IsFavorite` through `WorkspaceService.SetFavorite` and pinned rows sort to the top (`WorkspaceDisplayOrder`, pure and pinned by a test). Re-ordering uses `ObservableCollection.Move`, **never remove-and-re-add**: a removal from that collection is how `MainWindowViewModel` learns a workspace is gone, and it would answer a re-sort by disposing the workspace's tiles — which is why that handler now tests for `Remove` rather than for `OldItems != null` (a Move carries `OldItems` too).

**The list follows the row you are looking at.** Selecting a row highlights it and moves nothing —
the list is an `ItemsControl`, not a `ListBox` — so three gestures ask for the scroll themselves
(`WorkspacesPanelViewModel.RevealWorkspaceRequested`): adding a workspace, pinning or unpinning one
(the row moves to the top or back into the alphabet, which in a long list is anywhere at all), and the
panel opening on the workspace the last session left. That last one is the view's own doing rather than
a call from `MainWindowViewModel`: the restored workspace is selected before this view exists, so
nothing could have asked for it, and the application opened with the row it had just restored — and the
highlight that is the only thing saying which workspace is open — below the fold. The reveal is tried
twice, the second time at a lower priority, because at startup the row is asked for before the list has
been laid out and a container that does not exist yet answers exactly like a row that is not there.

**A row says whether it is loaded, and what that costs.** A workspace holds its tiles — and their
shells — from the first time it is opened until the window closes, so a day's work ends with six agents
resident and nothing on screen saying so. A loaded row is drawn at full strength and an unloaded one a
shade back (`WorkspaceItemViewModel.IsLoaded`, `Border.workspace-item-unloaded`): most rows in a long
list have never been opened, and a marker on nearly every row marks nothing, while a shade says it
without asking for a column. The reading itself sits at the right-hand end of the branch's line, which is
the one place on the row a number does not compete with a name — three characters wide, and the branch is
the fill child, so it trims rather than being run under. It is sampled every five seconds
(`MainWindowViewModel.SampleMemoryAsync`): the tree walk that collects the tiles' process ids is on the
UI thread because the tile tree is the UI thread's, and the reading of the machine's process table is not,
because that is a few hundred processes opened one at a time. **One reading answers every loaded
workspace** (`IProcessMemoryProbe.WorkingSetsOf` takes them all at once): a call per workspace would scan
the machine once per workspace every five seconds, and the figures would describe different instants.

**Unload is on the context menu, under Copy path, and it asks first.** It closes the workspace's tiles
without losing the workspace: the layout is on disk, so the same tiles come back on the next click — but
not the same sessions, which is why an unwired `ConfirmAction` answers no. The selection is cleared first
when it is the workspace on screen, or the row stays highlighted with its view gone and nothing able to
bring it back, since re-selecting an already-selected workspace raises no change. The menu item is dead
for a workspace that was never opened, which has nothing to give back.

A workspace is **one row: its name, and one line under it saying what it sits in** — and deliberately nothing else. What has stood there and been taken back out — an open/closed marker, a disclosure chevron and a count of the tiles under it, with the list of those tiles under that — was in every case either already on screen somewhere better or competing with the name for a row 240px wide, and the row ended up showing a count and an ellipsis where the name should have been. That second line is the branch where there is one, the offer to create a repository where one can be, and **the path where neither is true** — the home directory, a drive root, a system folder: those rows were the one place it came out blank, and a reserved line saying nothing is height spent on silence. The path is shown rather than a word for the kind of place, because on exactly those rows the *name* is already the word ("Home directory" is an alias) and the path is what says which profile, which drive. It trims, which is why it is in a `DockPanel` behind a docked glyph and not in a horizontal `StackPanel` — one of those measures its children with infinite width, so `TextTrimming` in it never fires and a long path runs out of the row and is cut mid-character by the scroller. The full path is still in the row's tooltip.

**The second line is what settles the competition.** Side by side, the name and the branch bid for the same 240px and the name kept losing — it was the one that had to give way, so a row came out as "B…" beside a fully spelled-out `feature/ui-redesign`. A line each costs a few pixels of height and ends the argument, which is why there is no longer any width below which the branch is hidden.

**The meta line is always there and always the same height** (a fixed-height `Panel` holding it), whatever it has to say. Showing it only for repositories gave the list two row heights interleaved at random, which is the one thing a column of twenty names cannot afford — nothing lines up and the eye has no rhythm to scan by. Reserving the line also covers the moment before the check has answered.

A workspace that is **not** a repository gets an offer in that line rather than a label: **Create repository** runs `git init` after a confirmation (`WorkspacesPanelViewModel.CreateRepositoryCommand`). Saying only "no repository" would leave the user to go and find a terminal to type the answer into; asking first is because `git init` writes into somebody's folder from a row they are otherwise clicking to switch workspaces, and an unwired `ConfirmAction` answers **no**. `WorkspaceItemViewModel.HasRepository` is `bool?` and the third state is the one that matters: the check is asynchronous, and a plain `bool` would have every repository in the list announce it had none until the first pass finished.

**Not every directory without a repository gets the offer.** `SpecialDirectories.Kind` names what kind of place a path is — home, Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Pictures, Music, Videos, the root of a drive, a system directory, an ordinary project folder, or one nothing could read — and `AllowsRepository` is *derived* from it (`Kind(path) == Ordinary`) rather than deciding again, so the glyph on a row and the offer on it cannot reach different conclusions about the same path. A repository at `~` tracks every download and every application's configuration, and its first `git status` takes minutes; the drive root and the system directories are that mistake one step larger, the user's own file folders one step smaller — and those are the folders somebody browsing for a workspace lands in by accident. **The user folders match only themselves, never their children** — that is the whole difference from the system directories: a project under `~/Documents` is an ordinary project. **Two of them are guessed by name** under the home directory, both because the platform will not say: Downloads, which has no `SpecialFolder` at all, and — on Unix only — Documents, whose `SpecialFolder` answers with `$HOME` there (`MyDocuments` is `Personal`), which left `~/Documents` the one of these six offered a repository on Linux. That mapping is also why `Kind` answers `Home` and not `Documents` for `MyDocuments` on Linux, which is correct: the path *is* the home directory. A guess that misses — a localized `Dokumenty`, a relocated Downloads — is simply not found, and a folder that is not found is an ordinary one, which is the safe way round. **Those rows show their path instead** (`WorkspaceItemViewModel.ShowsDirectoryPath`, the complement of `HasNoRepository` among the rows with no repository): the meta line is reserved on every row, so leaving it blank was height spent on silence — and these are the rows the name covers for least, because on exactly these it is a kind of place rather than which one. "Home directory" is an alias this application chose, and it is the path that says which profile; a word for the kind would be the name a second time. **The glyph belongs to that line, not to the name** (`SpecialDirectoryIcon.Kind`, a converter in `Views/` for the reason `TileIcons` is there — which picture stands for a kind of place is a fact about the drawing): in front of the name a house said what the name already said, while the line that needed a mark carried a generic folder. One picture per kind — a house, a monitor, a document, a download, an image, a note, a film, a disk, a cog — and an unrecognised kind falls to a plain folder rather than throwing, because a wrong glyph is legible and an empty row is not. The path gets its own line and trims, which is what the row could not offer it beside the name — the reason it is in the tooltip everywhere else. A row nothing has checked yet still says nothing: `HasRepository` is null until the first pass answers, and a path there would be the row claiming to have been looked at. The rule is pure and shared, because the same "is this the home directory" also decides the workspace's name.

**A first run opens on one workspace holding one terminal** (`DefaultWorkspace.SeedFirstRun`, called from `App.axaml.cs` before the main window is built) — at the home directory, which is the one place every machine has and the user can certainly write to. **The condition is that there is no `workspaces.json` at all, not that the list is empty** (`WorkspaceService.HasStoredList`): `Load` answers every read failure with an empty list, so a file locked by another instance or truncated by a power cut is indistinguishable from a first run — and seeding writes, which would replace the user's whole list with this one workspace and orphan their layouts. The file is also what remembers the answer, so a user who removes their last workspace does not get it back on the next launch. It fails soft, because a home directory that cannot be written to is a reason to start on an empty panel and not a reason not to start.

**The home directory is displayed as "Home directory", not as the login.** A workspace takes its name from the last part of its path, which for `C:\Users\andrz` is `andrz` — the account, not the place. `WorkspaceDisplayName.For` is a display rule and not a rename: `workspaces.json` keeps whatever is stored, so the same file on a machine with a different login, or the workspace moved elsewhere, shows the directory's own name again. The row also **wears a house**, because a row in a list of folders is read as a folder and the words alone can be taken for one somebody made — but on the **meta line**, not in front of the name. In front of the name it said what the name already said; on the line under it, what kind of place this is *is* the thing being said, and the house is one of ten glyphs (`Views/SpecialDirectoryIcon.cs`, drawn from `WorkspaceItemViewModel.SpecialKind`) rather than the only one. **The list sorts by the alias, not by the glyph** — `WorkspaceDisplayOrder` compares `WorkspaceItemViewModel.Name`, so `Home directory` reads under H rather than under the login, and every alias `WorkspaceDisplayName` grows follows the same line; ordering on the mark as well would bunch the aliased rows at one end and override the alphabet the rest of the column is read by. Pinning stays the one thing that outranks the name. The filter matches the alias *and* the path, so the row is still found by typing the login.

**Plain text, not a chip** (`StackPanel.workspace-meta`). A chip is the language this application uses for the rare exception — the AI tool that is NOT FOUND, the database tile's Error — and it works because you see one at a time. A value present on every row is not an exception, it is metadata: twenty boxed outlines down the column gave the list a zigzag right edge and no rhythm to read it by, and put a third frame inside a card inside a canvas. It sits on **the same left margin as the name**, which is what leaves the panel one left edge to read down; right-aligned it had the same disconnected look the chip did.

**Selected is not hover.** Both were `InteractiveHover`, so pointing at a neighbour made it impossible to say which workspace was open — the one thing the list exists to tell you. Selected gets `BgElevated` and an accent down its leading edge, the marker the tiles already use for the same idea.

## InputDialog

Reusable modal dialog (`Views/InputDialog.axaml`): title, TextBox with placeholder, optional suggestions list (ListBox). Enter = OK, Escape = Cancel. Clicking a suggestion enters it into the TextBox. `ShowDialog<string?>` returns trimmed text or null.
