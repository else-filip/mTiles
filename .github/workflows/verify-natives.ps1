# breakage nobody notices until a user reports it, which is why it is checked here rather than trusted.

# runtimes/<rid>/ into the root, a framework-dependent build does not, and both are correct.

# What each entry is for, so a failure says more than a file name. Each platform takes a *list* of
# acceptable names, and the first one found satisfies the entry.
#
# The Linux names carry a trailing wildcard because an ELF shared library is as likely to be published
# under its soname - libportaudio.so.2, libonnxruntime.so.1.20.0 - as under the plain link name, and
# which of the two a NuGet package ships is the package's business. Today they are plain, checked in a
# publish; a package that starts shipping the versioned name would otherwise fail the release with
# "missing" against a file sitting right there.
#
# The alternatives on the ggml trio are a different brittleness, and one that is not a platform
# convention at all: the '-whisper' suffix is Whisper.net's own renaming of upstream's files, added at
# 1.8 to stop them colliding with another package's ggml. The plain names are what earlier versions
# shipped and what upstream still builds, so a downgrade or a repackaging brings them back on *both*
# platforms - which is why the wildcards do nothing for this and a list of names does. Note what is
# deliberately not done here: a leading-prefix wildcard such as 'ggml*.dll' would let the base library
# satisfy the entry for the dispatcher, so all three entries would pass on one file. The trailing
# wildcards are safe precisely because they come after the part that tells the three apart.
